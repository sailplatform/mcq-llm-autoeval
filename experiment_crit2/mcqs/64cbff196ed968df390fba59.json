Anne's roses are red and occupy 10% of the screen.\n2. Amina's lilies are white and occupy 15% of the screen.\n3. Anne's roses disappear from the screen when the user presses the spacebar.\n4. Anne's roses appear on the screen when the user presses the 'a' key.\n\nSetup 2\n* All stars twinkle and have a name.\n\n1. There are only two stars on the screen ('Alpha Centauri' and 'Vega').\n2.
