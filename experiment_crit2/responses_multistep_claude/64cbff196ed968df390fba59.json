They both have objects with attributes (flowers with color and size, stars with name and twinkling behavior).\n\n2. The objects in both setups have behaviors or methods (flowers appearing/disappearing, stars twinkling).\n\n3. Implementing these setups using objects would allow for modularity and reusability of code.
