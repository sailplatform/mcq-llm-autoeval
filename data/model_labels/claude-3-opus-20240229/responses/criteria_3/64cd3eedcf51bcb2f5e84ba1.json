The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem and adheres to the following properties.\n1. A distractor should not be obviously wrong. In other words, it must still bear relations to the stem and correct answer. \n2. A distractor should be phrased positively and be a true statement that does not correctly answer the stem, all while giving no clues towards the correct answer.\n3. Although a distractor is incorrect, it must be plausible: in other words, it must be positioned such that a student who does not fully grasp the topic may believe that the distractor is the correct answer choice. \n4. A distractor must be incorrect. It cannot be correct, or interpreted as correct by someone who strongly grasps the topic.\n\nThe term \"answer choices\" is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \"answer choice\" refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\n\n"

The first distractor states that the script inserts a new record into the 'students' table.\n\n2. The second distractor states that the script deletes the 'students' table.\n\nWhile both distractors are related to the 'students' table and database operations, they refer to completely different actions (inserting a record vs. deleting the table). \n\nTo improve these distractors, they could be made more homogeneous and parallel in nature. For example, the distractors could both refer to different types of SQL queries, such as:\n\n1. The script updates all records in the 'students' table.\n2. The script counts the number of records in the 'students' table.\n\nThis would make the distractors more similar in format and structure to the correct answer, while still being distinctly incorrect. Having more closely related distractors can better test the student's understanding of the specific SQL query and operation being performed in the code snippet."

If the options contain code that lead to the same outcomes, then they are similar choices. This principle can be evaluated as one of the following three options, label the evaluations as options 1 through 3.\n1: Yes, they are completely unique between each other\n2: They are not completely unique, but are still good quality\n3: No, they are all too similar, making them repeated choices\n\nWhen asked to evaluate a question, return the evaluation key.
