The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem and adheres to the following properties.\n1. A distractor should not be obviously wrong. In other words, it must still bear relations to the stem and correct answer. \n2. A distractor should be phrased positively and be a true statement that does not correctly answer the stem, all while giving no clues towards the correct answer.\n3. Although a distractor is incorrect, it must be plausible: in other words, it must be positioned such that a student who does not fully grasp the topic may believe that the distractor is the correct answer choice. \n4. A distractor must be incorrect. It cannot be correct, or interpreted as correct by someone who strongly grasps the topic.\n\nThe term \"answer choices\" is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \"answer choice\" refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\n\n"

The similarities could potentially make the distractors plausible for a student without full understanding, while the unique aspects ensure they are not overly repetitive."

This principle can be evaluated as one of the following three options, label the evaluations as options 1 through 3.\n1: Yes, they are completely unique between each other\n2: They are not completely unique, but are still good quality\n3: No, they are all too similar, making them repeated choices\n\nWhen asked to evaluate a question, return the evaluation key.
