The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem and adheres to the following properties.\n1. A distractor should not be obviously wrong. In other words, it must still bear relations to the stem and correct answer. \n2. A distractor should be phrased positively and be a true statement that does not correctly answer the stem, all while giving no clues towards the correct answer.\n3. Although a distractor is incorrect, it must be plausible: in other words, it must be positioned such that a student who does not fully grasp the topic may believe that the distractor is the correct answer choice. Later provided with the topic and context students will be assessed on is a list of common misconceptions within that topic. \n4. A distractor must be incorrect. It cannot be correct, or interpreted as correct by someone who strongly grasps the topic.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\n\n"

        "content": "The provided multiple-choice question has a few issues that may not provide enough context for a student to answer it correctly:\n\n1. The question stem is ambiguous. It asks about a \"boolean value\" but doesn't specify whether it's referring to the boolean data type or the literal values that evaluate to True or False. This lack of clarity could confuse students.\n\n2. The correct answer, 'False', is a string literal, not a boolean value. In Python, the boolean values are True and False (without quotes). The question should clarify if it's asking about the string representation or the actual boolean values.\n\n3. The distractors, while related to the topic, don't provide enough context. The integer 0 and the None keyword can be used in boolean contexts, but they are not boolean values themselves. The question should be more specific about what it's asking.\n\nTo improve the question, consider the following:\n\n1. Clarify the question stem to specify whether you're asking about the boolean data type or the literal values that evaluate to True or False.\n\n2. If the correct answer is meant to be the string 'False', update the question to ask about the string representation of boolean values. If the correct answer should be the boolean value False, remove the quotes.\n\n3. Provide more context in the distractors. For example, mention that 0 and None can be used in boolean contexts but are not boolean values themselves.\n\nBy making these changes, the question will provide better context and clarity for students to answer correctly."
