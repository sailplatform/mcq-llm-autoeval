The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem and adheres to the following properties.\n1. A distractor should not be obviously wrong. In other words, it must still bear relations to the stem and correct answer. \n2. A distractor should be phrased positively and be a true statement that does not correctly answer the stem, all while giving no clues towards the correct answer.\n3. Although a distractor is incorrect, it must be plausible: in other words, it must be positioned such that a student who does not fully grasp the topic may believe that the distractor is the correct answer choice. Later provided with the topic and context students will be assessed on is a list of common misconceptions within that topic. \n4. A distractor must be incorrect. It cannot be correct, or interpreted as correct by someone who strongly grasps the topic.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\n\n"

The DataFrame has two indexes: 'Genre' and 'Year', and two columns: 'Average Rating' and 'Number of Ratings'. Sam wants to collaboratively filter the DataFrame by computing the average of 'Average Rating' across the 'Year' index. She has the following piece of Python code, but is unsure about the correct value for the 'axis' parameter in the mean() function.\\n\\nratings_by_genre_year.mean(axis = ?)\\n\\nIn this context, what should Sam set for the value of the axis parameter?\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"0 (Zero)\",\n            \"correct\": \"true\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"1 (One)\",\n            \"correct\": \"false\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"'Genre'\",\n            \"correct\": \"false\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"'Year'\",\n            \"correct\": \"false\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nDo the question text and it's choices provide enough information or context for a student to answer it correctly?"

        "content": "The question text provides good context about the scenario and the specific task Sam is trying to accomplish. However, there are a few areas where additional information or clarification could be beneficial for the student to confidently answer the question:\n\n1. The question doesn't explicitly mention that Sam wants to compute the average across the 'Genre' index. It only states that she wants to compute the average across the 'Year' index. Making this clear would help the student understand the desired operation better.\n\n2. It would be helpful to provide a small sample of the DataFrame's structure to visually illustrate how the indexes and columns are organized. This would make it easier for the student to understand the context and the effect of using different axis values.\n\n3. The question could briefly explain what the axis parameter in the mean() function does and how it relates to the indexes and columns of the DataFrame. This would help the student make a more informed decision about the correct axis value.\n\n4. The incorrect choices ('Genre' and 'Year') are a bit ambiguous. It's not clear if they refer to the string literals or if they are meant to represent the axis values corresponding to those indexes. Clarifying this would make the choices more precise.\n\nOverall, the question is well-structured and tests a specific concept, but providing a bit more context and clarity around the DataFrame's structure and the axis parameter would enhance its effectiveness in assessing the student's understanding of the topic."
