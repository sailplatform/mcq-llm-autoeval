The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem and adheres to the following properties.\n1. A distractor should not be obviously wrong. In other words, it must still bear relations to the stem and correct answer. \n2. A distractor should be phrased positively and be a true statement that does not correctly answer the stem, all while giving no clues towards the correct answer.\n3. Although a distractor is incorrect, it must be plausible: in other words, it must be positioned such that a student who does not fully grasp the topic may believe that the distractor is the correct answer choice. Later provided with the topic and context students will be assessed on is a list of common misconceptions within that topic. \n4. A distractor must be incorrect. It cannot be correct, or interpreted as correct by someone who strongly grasps the topic.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\n\n"

        "content": "The provided multiple-choice question lacks sufficient context and information for a student to answer it correctly. Here are a few issues with the question:\n\n1. Insufficient context in the stem: The question does not provide any context about the student's expected knowledge of Python data types and comparison operators. It assumes the student is familiar with the concept of comparing a string and an integer using the equality operator (==).\n\n2. Missing distractors: The question only provides two answer choices, the correct answer (False) and one distractor (True). A well-constructed multiple-choice question should have one correct answer and two plausible distractors.\n\n3. Lack of feedback: The answer choices do not include any feedback explaining why the choice is correct or incorrect. Feedback is essential for reinforcing the student's understanding of the concept being tested.\n\n4. Limited assessment scope: The question only assesses a single, specific case of comparing a string and an integer. It does not assess the student's broader understanding of data type comparisons in Python.\n\nTo improve the question, consider the following:\n\n1. Provide more context in the stem about the student's expected knowledge of Python data types and comparison operators.\n2. Add one more plausible distractor that represents a common misconception or error.\n3. Include feedback for each answer choice to explain why it is correct or incorrect.\n4. Consider expanding the scope of the question to assess the student's understanding of data type comparisons more comprehensively."

Think of this from the perspective of a student answering the multiple-choice question. This principle can be evaluated as one of the following two options, label the evaluations as options 1 through 2.\n1: Yes, it provides enough information\n2: No, it doesn't provide enough information\n\nWhen asked to evaluate a question, return the evaluation key.
