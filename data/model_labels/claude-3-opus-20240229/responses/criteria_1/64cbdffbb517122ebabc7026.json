The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem and adheres to the following properties.\n1. A distractor should not be obviously wrong. In other words, it must still bear relations to the stem and correct answer. \n2. A distractor should be phrased positively and be a true statement that does not correctly answer the stem, all while giving no clues towards the correct answer.\n3. Although a distractor is incorrect, it must be plausible: in other words, it must be positioned such that a student who does not fully grasp the topic may believe that the distractor is the correct answer choice. Later provided with the topic and context students will be assessed on is a list of common misconceptions within that topic. \n4. A distractor must be incorrect. It cannot be correct, or interpreted as correct by someone who strongly grasps the topic.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\n\n"

        "content": "The question text and choices provide a good amount of information and context for a student with basic knowledge of the pandas library to answer correctly. Here's why:\n\n1. The question stem clearly specifies the library (pandas) and the object type (Series) that the question is focusing on. This helps set the context for the student.\n\n2. The correct answer choice accurately states a key characteristic of Series objects - that they are built on top of numpy arrays. A student who has worked with pandas Series objects should be able to recognize this.\n\n3. The two distractor choices are plausible misconceptions or incorrect statements about Series objects:\n   - Stating that Series can only contain strings is incorrect, as Series can hold various data types.\n   - Stating that Series do not support element-wise operations like numpy arrays is also incorrect, as Series do support vectorized operations.\n\n4. All three answer choices are related to the properties of pandas Series objects, so they are relevant and should not be obviously incorrect to a student with a basic understanding of the topic.\n\n5. The answer choices are also fairly parallel in structure and length.\n\nSo in summary, I believe this question is well-constructed to test a student's understanding of pandas Series objects, assuming the student has been introduced to the pandas library and has some familiarity with Series properties and operations. The question provides enough context and plausible answer choices to effectively assess their knowledge."
