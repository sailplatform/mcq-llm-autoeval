The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem and adheres to the following properties.\n1. A distractor should not be obviously wrong. In other words, it must still bear relations to the stem and correct answer. \n2. A distractor should be phrased positively and be a true statement that does not correctly answer the stem, all while giving no clues towards the correct answer.\n3. Although a distractor is incorrect, it must be plausible: in other words, it must be positioned such that a student who does not fully grasp the topic may believe that the distractor is the correct answer choice. Later provided with the topic and context students will be assessed on is a list of common misconceptions within that topic. \n4. A distractor must be incorrect. It cannot be correct, or interpreted as correct by someone who strongly grasps the topic.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\n\n"

        "content": "The provided multiple-choice question lacks sufficient information and context for a student to answer it correctly. Here are the issues:\n\n1. The question stem is incomplete. It mentions a Richter Scale table and an `earthquake_category` function, but the actual question or problem statement is missing. It's unclear what the student is supposed to determine or solve.\n\n2. The code snippet for the `earthquake_category` function is incomplete. The conditions for each `if` and `elif` statement are missing, represented by placeholders like `__I__`, `__II__`, etc. Without the complete function implementation, it's impossible to evaluate the correctness of the given expression `mag > 3 or mag == 3`.\n\n3. The question does not provide any information about the variable `mag` used in the expression. It's unclear what `mag` represents or where its value comes from.\n\n4. The answer choices \"True\" and \"False\" are not meaningful without a clear question statement. It's ambiguous what the student is supposed to evaluate as true or false.\n\nTo improve this multiple-choice question, the following changes should be made:\n\n1. Provide a clear and complete question statement that specifies what the student needs to determine or solve.\n\n2. Include the complete implementation of the `earthquake_category` function, filling in the missing conditions for each `if` and `elif` statement.\n\n3. Clarify what the variable `mag` represents and how its value is obtained.\n\n4. Ensure that the answer choices are relevant and unambiguous based on the complete question statement.\n\nWithout these improvements, the current question lacks the necessary information and context for a student to provide an informed answer."
