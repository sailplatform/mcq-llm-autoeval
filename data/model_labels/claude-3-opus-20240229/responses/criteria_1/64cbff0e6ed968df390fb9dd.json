The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem and adheres to the following properties.\n1. A distractor should not be obviously wrong. In other words, it must still bear relations to the stem and correct answer. \n2. A distractor should be phrased positively and be a true statement that does not correctly answer the stem, all while giving no clues towards the correct answer.\n3. Although a distractor is incorrect, it must be plausible: in other words, it must be positioned such that a student who does not fully grasp the topic may believe that the distractor is the correct answer choice. Later provided with the topic and context students will be assessed on is a list of common misconceptions within that topic. \n4. A distractor must be incorrect. It cannot be correct, or interpreted as correct by someone who strongly grasps the topic.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\n\n"

        "content": "The provided multiple-choice question does contain enough information and context for a student to answer it correctly, given the student has a basic understanding of Python syntax and conditional statements. Here's the analysis:\n\n1. The question stem clearly states the objective: to fill in the blank of the `is_negative` function definition so that it returns `True` when the argument `num` is a negative number and `False` otherwise.\n\n2. The question provides the necessary context by showing the function definition with the blank space where the condition should be filled in.\n\n3. The correct answer, `num < 0`, directly addresses the question's requirement. It correctly checks if the number is less than 0, which is the condition for a negative number.\n\n4. The distractors are plausible and related to the question:\n   - `not (num > 0)` is incorrect because it checks if the number is not greater than 0, which includes 0 itself.\n   - `num > 0` is incorrect as it checks for a positive number instead of a negative number.\n   - `num <= 0` is incorrect because it includes 0, which is not a negative number.\n\n5. The answer choices are homogeneous and parallel in format, as they all represent valid Python conditions.\n\nIn summary, a student with a basic understanding of Python and conditional statements should be able to answer this question correctly based on the provided information and context."
