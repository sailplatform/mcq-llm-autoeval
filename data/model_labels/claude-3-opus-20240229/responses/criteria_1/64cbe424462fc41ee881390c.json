The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem and adheres to the following properties.\n1. A distractor should not be obviously wrong. In other words, it must still bear relations to the stem and correct answer. \n2. A distractor should be phrased positively and be a true statement that does not correctly answer the stem, all while giving no clues towards the correct answer.\n3. Although a distractor is incorrect, it must be plausible: in other words, it must be positioned such that a student who does not fully grasp the topic may believe that the distractor is the correct answer choice. Later provided with the topic and context students will be assessed on is a list of common misconceptions within that topic. \n4. A distractor must be incorrect. It cannot be correct, or interpreted as correct by someone who strongly grasps the topic.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\n\n"

        "content": "The question stem provides good context about the task of extracting email addresses from a dataset using regular expressions in Python. It also clearly states that the given regular expression is incorrect, and asks for the correct one to replace it.\n\nHowever, there are a few potential issues with the answer choices:\n\n1. The correct answer looks good - it is a comprehensive regular expression that should match most valid email addresses. \n\n2. The first distractor looks plausible and could trick students who don't have a strong grasp of regular expressions. However, it is a bit more restrictive than the correct answer (e.g. limiting the TLD to 2-6 characters).\n\n3. The second distractor has some issues. It is very similar to the correct answer, just missing a few elements like allowing underscores and percent signs in the username. More importantly though, it doesn't escape the dot in the domain part, meaning it would match invalid domains with multiple dots in a row.\n\nTo improve this question, I would suggest:\n\n- Ensuring the distractors are clearly incorrect to someone who understands regular expressions well, while still being plausible to someone with incomplete knowledge. The second distractor is a bit too close to being correct.\n\n- Potentially providing some examples of email addresses that should be matched or rejected to help students reason about the correct answer.\n\n- Clarifying in the stem that the regex should be as comprehensive as possible in matching valid email addresses.\n\nOverall, the question is pretty good at testing knowledge of regular expressions in a practical context, but some tweaks to the distractors and a bit more clarity in the stem could improve it further. The information provided should be sufficient for a student with solid regex skills to identify the correct answer."
