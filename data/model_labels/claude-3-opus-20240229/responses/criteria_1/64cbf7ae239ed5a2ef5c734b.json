The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem and adheres to the following properties.\n1. A distractor should not be obviously wrong. In other words, it must still bear relations to the stem and correct answer. \n2. A distractor should be phrased positively and be a true statement that does not correctly answer the stem, all while giving no clues towards the correct answer.\n3. Although a distractor is incorrect, it must be plausible: in other words, it must be positioned such that a student who does not fully grasp the topic may believe that the distractor is the correct answer choice. Later provided with the topic and context students will be assessed on is a list of common misconceptions within that topic. \n4. A distractor must be incorrect. It cannot be correct, or interpreted as correct by someone who strongly grasps the topic.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\n\n"

        "content": "The question text and choices provide enough information and context for a student to answer the question correctly, given they have a solid understanding of variable scope in Python. Here's the analysis:\n\n1. The question stem includes a Python code snippet that clearly demonstrates the concept being tested - variable scope and how it behaves with nested functions. The code is complete and can be run without any modifications.\n\n2. The correct answer, \"'Hello!'\", is undisputable. When outer_function() is called, it assigns 'Hello!' to outer_value. Although inner_function() is called and assigns 'Goodbye!' to a variable with the same name, it's within the inner function's scope and doesn't affect the outer_value in outer_function(). Therefore, when outer_value is printed, it outputs 'Hello!'.\n\n3. The distractors are plausible and not obviously wrong:\n   - \"'Goodbye!'\" might be chosen by a student who doesn't fully grasp variable scope and thinks the assignment in inner_function() overwrites the outer_value in outer_function().\n   - \"The program throws a NameError.\" could be selected by a student who confuses variable scope rules and thinks outer_value is not accessible within inner_function().\n\n4. The answer choices are parallel in structure and length, not providing any clues to the correct answer.\n\nIn summary, the question effectively assesses a student's understanding of variable scope in Python, with a clear, executable code example, an undisputable correct answer, and plausible distractors. The question provides sufficient information for a student with the expected knowledge to answer correctly."
