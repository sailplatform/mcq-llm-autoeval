The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \"answer choices\" is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \"answer choice\" refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

The question is a simple statement, and the answer choices are \"True\" and \"False\".\n\nSince there is no code present in the question or answer choices, there is no need to evaluate the syntactic or logical correctness of any code.\n\nHowever, there are a couple of issues with the structure of this multiple-choice question:\n\n1. The question only has two answer choices, while a proper multiple-choice question should have one correct answer and two distractors (incorrect choices). This question is missing one distractor.\n\n2. The question stem is a subjective statement rather than a clear, objective question or problem. The stem should focus on assessing a specific piece of knowledge or concept.\n\nTo improve this question, the stem should be rephrased to be more objective and specific, and an additional distractor should be added to the answer choices."
