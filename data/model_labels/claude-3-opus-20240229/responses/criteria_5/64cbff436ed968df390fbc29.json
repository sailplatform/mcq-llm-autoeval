The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "Yes, the question contains a code snippet in Python. The code is syntactically correct. It will run without any errors.\n\nLogically, the code is also correct. Here's what it does:\n\n1. `nums = []` creates an empty list called `nums`.\n2. `vals = nums` makes `vals` reference the same list object as `nums`. They are essentially two names pointing to the same list.\n3. `vals.append(1)` appends the integer 1 to the list referenced by `vals`. Since `vals` and `nums` point to the same list, this operation also modifies `nums`.\n\nAfter the code runs, both `nums` and `vals` will be `[1]`. They are references to the same list object, so they will always have the same length.\n\nThe code demonstrates that in Python, when you assign one list to another variable, it creates a new reference to the same list object, rather than creating a new copy of the list."
