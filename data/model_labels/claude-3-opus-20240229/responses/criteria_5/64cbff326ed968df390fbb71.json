The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \"answer choices\" is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \"answer choice\" refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "Yes, the question contains a code snippet written in Python. Let's analyze the code:\n\n```python\ndef func(a, b):\n    return a ** b\n\nprint(func(2))\n```\n\nThe code defines a function `func` that takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns the result of `a` raised to the power of `b` using the exponentiation operator `**`.\n\nHowever, when calling the function `func(2)`, only one argument is provided, whereas the function expects two arguments. This will result in a `TypeError` because the function is missing a required positional argument `b`.\n\nTherefore, the code is syntactically correct but logically incorrect due to the missing argument in the function call.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the answer choices:\n\n1. \"will output 4\" - Incorrect. The code will raise a `TypeError` due to the missing argument.\n2. \"will return None\" - Incorrect. The code will raise a `TypeError` before reaching the `return` statement.\n3. \"is erroneous\" - Correct. The code is erroneous because it is missing an argument in the function call.\n4. \"will output 2\" - Incorrect. The code will raise a `TypeError` and will not output anything.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is choice 3: \"is erroneous\"."
