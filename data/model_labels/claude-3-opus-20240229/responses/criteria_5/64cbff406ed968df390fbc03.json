The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \"answer choices\" is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \"answer choice\" refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "Let me evaluate this multiple-choice question:\n\nFirst, attempting to answer it as a student familiar with Python:\n\nThe code snippet in the stem has a syntax error. `in` and `out` are reserved keywords in Python and cannot be used as parameter names in a function definition. So the correct answer is \"the snippet is erroneous (invalid syntax)\".\n\nNow evaluating the question:\n\nYes, the question stem contains a Python code snippet. \n\nThe code is not syntactically correct. As mentioned, `in` and `out` are reserved keywords and invalid as parameter names, which will raise a `SyntaxError` when the code is parsed.\n\nSince the code has invalid syntax, its logic cannot be evaluated. The code is logically incorrect by virtue of being syntactically invalid.\n\nThe question has one correct answer and two distractors, which is the proper format.\n\nThe distractors \"6\" and \"9\" are the expected outputs if the function could run with the default argument values, so they are plausible distractors for a student who misses the syntax error.\n\nIn summary, this is a valid and well-constructed multiple-choice question that tests the student's knowledge of Python syntax and reserved keywords. The code snippet having an error is intentional as identifying that error is the objective of the question."

This principle can be evaluated as one of the following four options, label the evaluations as options 1 through 4.\n1: The code is syntactically and logically correct\n2: There are minor syntax/logical issues\n3: The code in incomprehensible\n4: There is no code in the question\n\nWhen asked to evaluate a question, return the evaluation key.
