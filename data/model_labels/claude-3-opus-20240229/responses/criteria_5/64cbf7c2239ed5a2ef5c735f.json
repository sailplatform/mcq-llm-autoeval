The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \"answer choices\" is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \"answer choice\" refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

Let's evaluate the code:\n\n```python\ndef func1():\n    try:\n        a = int('10')\n        b = int('python')\n    except ValueError:\n        return 'Execution of this block failed due to ValueError.'\nfunc1()\n```\n\nThe code is syntactically correct. It defines a function `func1()` that tries to convert two strings to integers using the `int()` function. The first conversion, `int('10')`, will succeed because '10' is a valid integer. However, the second conversion, `int('python')`, will raise a `ValueError` because 'python' cannot be converted to an integer.\n\nThe code is also logically correct. It uses a `try-except` block to handle the `ValueError` that will be raised when trying to convert 'python' to an integer. When the `ValueError` is caught, the function returns the string 'Execution of this block failed due to ValueError.'.\n\nFinally, the function `func1()` is called, so it will execute and return the string 'Execution of this block failed due to ValueError.'.\n\nTherefore, the code is both syntactically and logically correct, and it will produce the expected output."
