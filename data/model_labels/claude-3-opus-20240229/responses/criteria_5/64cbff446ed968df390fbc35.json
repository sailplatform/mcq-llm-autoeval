The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \"answer choices\" is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \"answer choice\" refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

The closing parenthesis for the `chr()` function is misplaced. It should be:\n\n```python\nprint(chr(ord('p') + 2))\n```\n\nWith this correction, the code is syntactically valid.\n\nLogically, the code does the following:\n1. `ord('p')` returns the Unicode code point of the character 'p', which is 112.\n2. `112 + 2` evaluates to `114`.\n3. `chr(114)` returns the character corresponding to the Unicode code point 114, which is 'r'.\n\nSo, if the syntax error is fixed, the code will print the character 'r'.\n\nHowever, the question JSON contains 4 answer choices instead of 3 (1 correct answer and 2 distractors). The question format is incorrect."
