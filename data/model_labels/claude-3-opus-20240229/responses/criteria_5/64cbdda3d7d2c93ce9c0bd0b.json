The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \"answer choices\" is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \"answer choice\" refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "Yes, the question contains Python code. Let me analyze the code:\n\n```python\ndef compare(val):\n    if val > 10 and val <= 20:\n        return 'In range'\n    else:\n        return 'Out of range'\n\nprint(compare(15))\nprint(compare(25))\n```\n\nThe code is syntactically correct. It defines a function called `compare` that takes a parameter `val`. The function checks if `val` is greater than 10 and less than or equal to 20. If the condition is true, it returns the string 'In range'. Otherwise, it returns the string 'Out of range'.\n\nThe code then calls the `compare` function twice, first with the argument `15` and then with the argument `25`, and prints the returned values.\n\nLogically, the code is also correct. When `compare(15)` is called, the condition `val > 10 and val <= 20` evaluates to `True` because 15 is indeed greater than 10 and less than or equal to 20. Therefore, the function will return 'In range'.\n\nWhen `compare(25)` is called, the condition `val > 10 and val <= 20` evaluates to `False` because 25 is greater than 20. Therefore, the function will return 'Out of range'.\n\nSo, the expected output of the code would be:\n```\nIn range\nOut of range\n```\n\nThe code is both syntactically and logically correct."
