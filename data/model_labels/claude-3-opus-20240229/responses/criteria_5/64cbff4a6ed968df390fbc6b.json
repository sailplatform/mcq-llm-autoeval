The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \"answer choices\" is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \"answer choice\" refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

It imports the `datetime` class from the `datetime` module.\n2. It creates two `datetime` objects:\n   - `datetime_1` is set to November 27, 2019, at 11:27:22.\n   - `datetime_2` is set to November 27, 2019, at 00:00:00 (midnight).\n3. It subtracts `datetime_2` from `datetime_1` and prints the result.\n\nThe result of subtracting two `datetime` objects is a `timedelta` object, which represents a duration or difference between two dates or times.\n\nIn this case, the expected output would be:\n```\n11:27:22\n```\n\nThis is because the difference between the two `datetime` objects is 11 hours, 27 minutes, and 22 seconds.\n\nSo, the code is syntactically and logically correct, and it aligns with the correct answer choice provided in the JSON object."
