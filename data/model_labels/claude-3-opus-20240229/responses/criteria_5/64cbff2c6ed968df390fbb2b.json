The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \"answer choices\" is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \"answer choice\" refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

Let's evaluate the code:\n\n```python\ni = 0\nwhile i < i + 2:\n    i += 1\n    print('*')\nelse:\nprint('*')\n```\n\nThe code is syntactically correct. However, there is a logical issue with the while loop condition.\n\nIn the first iteration, `i` is 0, so the condition `i < i + 2` evaluates to `0 < 0 + 2`, which is `True`. The loop body executes, incrementing `i` to 1 and printing a star.\n\nIn the second iteration, `i` is 1, and the condition `i < i + 2` evaluates to `1 < 1 + 2`, which is still `True`. The loop body executes again, incrementing `i` to 2 and printing another star.\n\nIn the third iteration, `i` is 2, and the condition `i < i + 2` evaluates to `2 < 2 + 2`, which is also `True`. The loop continues executing indefinitely because the condition `i < i + 2` will always be `True` for any value of `i`.\n\nTherefore, the code will enter an infinite loop, printing one star per line indefinitely.\n\nThe code is syntactically correct but contains a logical error that leads to an infinite loop."
