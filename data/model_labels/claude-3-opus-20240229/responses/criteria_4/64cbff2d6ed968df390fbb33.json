The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \"answer choices\" is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \"answer choice\" refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "Let me evaluate this question by first trying to answer it as a student familiar with Python.\n\nThe question stem provides a code snippet that creates a tuple foo containing (1, 2, 3). It then tries to find the index of the value 0 in the tuple using foo.index(0).\n\nLooking at the answer choices:\n\n1. \"The program will output 1 to the screen.\" - This is incorrect. The index method does not output anything, it returns the index if found.\n\n2. \"The program will cause an AttributeError exception.\" - This is incorrect. Tuples do have an index method, so no AttributeError will occur.\n\n3. \"The program will cause a SyntaxError exception.\" - The code is syntactically correct, so this is not the right answer.\n\n4. \"The program will cause a TypeError exception.\" - The index method expects an element as an argument, not an index, so the type is correct. Not a TypeError.\n\n5. \"The program will cause a ValueError exception.\" - This looks correct. The value 0 is not present in the tuple, so index will raise a ValueError.\n\nAs a student, I would select choice 5 as the correct answer.\n\nNow, evaluating the distractors:\n\nDistractor 1 is a plausible misconception. A student might think index outputs the value rather than raising an exception. \n\nDistractor 2 is also a reasonable distractor. If a student is unsure if tuples have an index method, they might select this.\n\nDistractor 3 is weaker. The code is clearly syntactically valid. Most students would likely eliminate this.\n\nDistractor 4 is a good distractor. Confusing the argument type for index is a likely mistake.\n\nOverall, 3 of the 4 distractors are quite strong. They represent common misconceptions or errors. Only distractor 3 is easily eliminated. \n\nIn summary, this is a well-constructed multiple-choice question. The distractors, for the most part, are plausible and not easily ruled out, which effectively tests the student's understanding."
