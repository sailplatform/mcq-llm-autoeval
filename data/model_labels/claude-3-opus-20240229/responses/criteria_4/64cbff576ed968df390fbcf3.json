The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \"answer choices\" is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \"answer choice\" refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "Let me first try to answer the question as a student familiar with Python.\n\nThe code is comparing the value of the mathematical constant e (approximately 2.71828) with 2 raised to the power of 4 (which equals 16). These values are not equal, so the != operator will return True. \n\nThis boolean True value is then passed to int(), which converts True to the integer 1.\n\nTherefore, the expected output printed will be 1.\n\nNow, evaluating the distractors:\n\n1. `False` - This is incorrect but a plausible distractor. A student might think the inequality evaluates to False if they don't know the values being compared.\n\n2. `1` - This is the correct answer.\n\n3. `0` - This is incorrect but a plausible distractor. A student might pick this if they think the inequality evaluates to False, and False converts to 0 in int().\n\n4. `True` - This is incorrect and not a great distractor. While the inequality does evaluate to True, the question asks about the integer value printed. A student with a clear understanding would likely not pick this.\n\nOverall, 2 of the 3 distractors are quite good. They represent plausible misunderstandings or mistakes a student might make. The `True` distractor is weaker, as a student with a good grasp of the concepts would likely eliminate it easily.\n\nTo improve, I would suggest replacing the `True` distractor with something like `2`, which a student might pick if they think True converts to 2 in int() (confusing it with boolean-to-integer conversion in some other languages).\n\nBut in general, the distractors are fairly effective at distinguishing students with a solid understanding from those with incomplete knowledge or misconceptions."

This principle can be evaluated as one of the following two options, label the evaluations as options 1 through 2.\n1: There are no obviously wrong options that give away the answer easily\n2: There is at least one option that can be easily eliminated as being incorrect\n\nWhen asked to evaluate a question, return the evaluation key.
