The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "From the perspective of a student familiar with Python programming, I would evaluate the distractors in this multiple-choice question as follows:\n\nDistractor 1: \"Only `test_average_velocity()` will pass.\" - This is a good distractor. The `average_velocity` function returns a string instead of calculating the actual average velocity, so a student might mistakenly think this test would pass if they don't carefully examine the function's implementation.\n\nDistractor 2: \"`test_average_speed()` and `test_average_velocity()` will pass.\" - This is a good distractor. It builds upon the misconception from the first distractor by including the `test_average_speed()` which is actually correct. A student might select this if they realize `test_average_speed()` should pass but still believe `test_average_velocity()` would pass as well.\n\nDistractor 3: \"All three tests will pass.\" - This is a weak distractor. The `displacement` function has no implementation (only `pass`), so a student with a basic understanding of Python should easily eliminate this option.\n\nDistractor 4: \"None of the three tests will pass.\" - This is a good distractor. If a student focuses on the empty `displacement` function and the incorrect `average_velocity`, they might conclude that none of the tests will pass, overlooking the correct implementation of `average_speed`.\n\nIn summary, three out of the four distractors (1, 2, and 4) are effective and cannot be easily eliminated by a student with knowledge of Python. However, distractor 3 is weak and could be improved by providing an implementation for the `displacement` function that seems plausible but is incorrect. Overall, the distractors in this multiple-choice question are reasonably good, with room for minor improvement."
