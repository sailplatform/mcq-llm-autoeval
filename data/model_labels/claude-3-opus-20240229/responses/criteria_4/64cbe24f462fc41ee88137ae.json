The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \"answer choices\" is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \"answer choice\" refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "Let me evaluate this question from the perspective of a student familiar with Python programming.\n\nThe stem provides a clear context by showing a list of integers called \"numbers\". It then asks which line of code would correctly sort the list in descending order.\n\nLooking at the answer choices:\n\n1. numbers.reverse() - This would reverse the order of elements in the list, but it would not actually sort them. So this is incorrect.\n\n2. numbers.sort(reverse=True) - This looks correct. The sort() method sorts the list in-place, and passing reverse=True sorts it in descending order. I believe this is the right answer.\n\n3. sorted(numbers, reverse=True) - The sorted() function returns a new sorted list and does not modify the original list. So while this would return a new list sorted in descending order, it's not quite what the question is asking for.\n\nEvaluating the distractors:\n\nBoth distractor 1 and 3 are plausible incorrect answers for someone with incomplete knowledge of list sorting in Python. \n\nDistractor 1 uses the reverse() method which is related to changing list order, so it could be chosen by someone who confuses it with sorting.\n\nDistractor 3 uses the sorted() function with the correct reverse=True parameter, so it would sort in descending order. However, it returns a new list instead of modifying the original, which the question implies should happen. So it's a subtle distinction that could trip up some students.\n\nOverall, I think the distractors are quite good. They are related enough to the correct answer to seem plausible, but are distinctly incorrect in a way that tests specific knowledge of list sorting methods. I don't see any obviously wrong answers that could be easily eliminated.\n\nSo in summary, I believe this is a well-constructed multiple-choice question. The stem is clear, the correct answer is unambiguous, and the distractors are effective at discriminating between different levels of understanding of the concept being tested."
