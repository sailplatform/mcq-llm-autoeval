The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \"answer choices\" is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \"answer choice\" refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "Let me first try to answer this question as a student familiar with Python.\n\nThe ord() function returns the Unicode code point of a character. For 'z', this is 122. Subtracting 2 from 122 gives 120. The chr() function returns the character for a given Unicode code point. The character with code point 120 is 'x'.\n\nSo the correct answer is 'x'.\n\nNow let me evaluate the distractors:\n\n'y': This is the character just before 'z', so it's a plausible distractor if you mistakenly subtract 1 instead of 2. It can't be easily eliminated.\n\n'z': This would be the result if you forgot to subtract at all. Again, it's a mistake one could conceivably make, so it's a viable distractor.\n\n'a': This is not close to 'x' in the alphabet. It would be the result of subtracting 25 instead of 2. This seems less likely as a mistake and might be easier to eliminate.\n\nOverall, I think the distractors are fairly good. 'y' and 'z' represent understandable misconceptions or errors, while 'a', though perhaps a bit more obviously wrong, could catch students who are guessing or don't understand the concept at all.\n\nThe distractors cover a range of possible misunderstandings without being too easily eliminated. So I would say this is a well-constructed multiple-choice question."

This principle can be evaluated as one of the following two options, label the evaluations as options 1 through 2.\n1: There are no obviously wrong options that give away the answer easily\n2: There is at least one option that can be easily eliminated as being incorrect\n\nWhen asked to evaluate a question, return the evaluation key.
