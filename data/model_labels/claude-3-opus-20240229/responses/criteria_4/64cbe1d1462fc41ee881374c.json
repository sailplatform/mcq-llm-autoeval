The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \"answer choices\" is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \"answer choice\" refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "From the perspective of a student familiar with Python programming, I would evaluate the distractors in this multiple-choice question as follows:\n\nThe correct answer is simply \"condition\", as that is the proper syntax for a conditional expression in Python.\n\nRegarding the distractors:\n\n1. \"condition == True\" is a plausible distractor. While it would work logically, it is not the most concise or Pythonic way to write the conditional expression. A student who is not fully comfortable with the conditional expression syntax might select this, thinking the explicit comparison to True is necessary.\n\n2. \"condition is not False\" is also a plausible distractor. Again, it would work logically, but it is a convoluted way to express the condition. A student might select this if they are more comfortable with the \"is not\" syntax for checking truthiness, but don't realize that simply using \"condition\" is sufficient and preferred.\n\nBoth distractors are effective because they represent logical ways to check the truthiness of the condition, but they are not the most concise or idiomatic way to write a conditional expression in Python. A student needs to have a solid grasp of Python's conditional expression syntax to confidently select the correct answer over these distractors.\n\nIn summary, the distractors in this question are well-designed. They cannot be easily eliminated by a student with incomplete knowledge, as they represent plausible alternatives that would work logically, but are not the best way to write a conditional expression in Python. The question effectively tests a student's mastery of this specific Python syntax."

This principle can be evaluated as one of the following two options, label the evaluations as options 1 through 2.\n1: There are no obviously wrong options that give away the answer easily\n2: There is at least one option that can be easily eliminated as being incorrect\n\nWhen asked to evaluate a question, return the evaluation key.
