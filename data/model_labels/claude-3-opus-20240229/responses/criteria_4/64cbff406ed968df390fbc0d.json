The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \"answer choices\" is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \"answer choice\" refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

There must be no incorrect answers that can easily be eliminated.\n"

        "content": "From the perspective of a student familiar with Python programming, I would evaluate the distractors in this multiple-choice question as follows:\n\n1. \"appearance\" - This distractor is not a strong choice. The term \"appearance\" is not commonly associated with function parameters in Python. A student with basic knowledge of Python would likely be able to eliminate this option quickly.\n\n2. \"name\" - This distractor is a better choice compared to \"appearance\". In Python, parameters can be referred to by their names when using keyword arguments. However, the question specifically mentions \"positional parameter\", which implies that the order of the arguments matters, not the name. A student with a solid understanding of positional and keyword arguments might still be able to eliminate this distractor.\n\nOverall, the distractors in this multiple-choice question are not very strong. The distractor \"appearance\" is quite weak and can be easily eliminated by most students. The distractor \"name\" is slightly better but can still be eliminated by students who have a clear understanding of the difference between positional and keyword arguments.\n\nTo improve the question, the distractors should be more plausible and challenging. They should represent common misconceptions or closely related concepts that might confuse students who do not have a deep understanding of the topic. For example, a distractor like \"data type\" or \"default value\" could be more effective, as they are related to function parameters but do not determine the meaning of a positional parameter."

This principle can be evaluated as one of the following two options, label the evaluations as options 1 through 2.\n1: There are no obviously wrong options that give away the answer easily\n2: There is at least one option that can be easily eliminated as being incorrect\n\nWhen asked to evaluate a question, return the evaluation key.
