The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \"answer choices\" is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \"answer choice\" refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "Let me first try to answer the question as a student familiar with Python programming.\n\nThe code implements the bubble sort algorithm. It uses nested loops to compare adjacent elements and swap them if they are in the wrong order. After each pass, the largest unsorted element \"bubbles up\" to its correct position at the end of the list. This process is repeated until the entire list is sorted.\n\nBased on this understanding, the correct answer is: \"It sorts the list in ascending order.\"\n\nNow, evaluating the distractors:\n\n1. \"It sorts the list in descending order.\" - This is a plausible distractor. The bubble sort algorithm could be modified to sort in descending order by changing the comparison condition. A student who doesn't fully understand the algorithm might think this is correct.\n\n2. \"It reverses the list.\" - This distractor is not as strong. Reversing a list is a different operation than sorting, and the code clearly shows comparisons and swaps, which are indicative of a sorting algorithm. A student with a basic understanding of sorting algorithms would likely eliminate this option.\n\nOverall, the distractors are of mixed quality. The first distractor is reasonably good, as it represents a common misconception or alternate implementation. The second distractor, however, is weaker and could be improved. A better distractor might be something like \"It finds the largest element in the list,\" which is a partial truth about what the bubble sort algorithm does in each pass.\n\nTo improve the question, I would suggest replacing the second distractor with a more plausible option that could challenge students' understanding of the bubble sort algorithm."
