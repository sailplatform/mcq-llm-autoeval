The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \"answer choices\" is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \"answer choice\" refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "From the perspective of a student familiar with Python programming, I would evaluate the distractors as follows:\n\nDistractor 1: \"Both functions return a new list, but the function f modifies the list passed as argument while the function g does not.\"\nThis distractor is plausible because it correctly states that function f modifies the list passed as an argument. However, it incorrectly states that both functions return a new list. The append() method used in function f returns None, not a new list. This distractor could potentially trick students who are not fully aware of the behavior of the append() method.\n\nDistractor 2: \"The function f appends 'Python' to lst1, while the function g appends 'Python' to lst2.\"\nThis distractor is less effective because it does not address the key difference between the two functions. While it is true that 'Python' is appended to lst1 in function f and 'Python' is appended to the new list in function g, this distractor does not highlight the crucial distinction between modifying the original list and creating a new list.\n\nOverall, the distractors are of mixed quality. Distractor 1 is a good distractor that could potentially mislead students who have a slight misunderstanding of the append() method. However, Distractor 2 is weaker and could be easily eliminated by students who understand the basic difference between modifying a list and creating a new one.\n\nTo improve the distractors, I would suggest replacing Distractor 2 with a statement that more closely resembles the correct answer but with a subtle mistake. For example:\n\n\"The function f returns a new list with 'Python' appended, while the function g modifies the original list passed as an argument.\"\n\nThis distractor maintains the parallel structure with the correct answer but reverses the key difference between the two functions, making it more challenging for students to identify the correct answer."
