The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \"answer choices\" is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \"answer choice\" refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "Let me evaluate this question from the perspective of a student familiar with Python programming.\n\nThe stem asks about the meaning of the equal sign (=) in the statement 'x = 5'. \n\nLooking at the answer choices:\n\n1. \"It means that 5 is equal to x.\" - This is incorrect. The equal sign in this context does not represent equality, but assignment.\n\n2. \"It means that the variable x is assigning the value 5.\" - This is close, but the phrasing is a bit off. We typically say a value is assigned to a variable, not that a variable is assigning a value.\n\n3. \"It means that the variable x is storing the value 5.\" - This is the correct answer. The equal sign is used for assignment, storing the value 5 in the variable x.\n\nEvaluating the distractors:\n\nDistractor 1 is a reasonable distractor. A novice Python programmer could potentially think the equal sign always represents equality. \n\nHowever, distractor 2 is quite close to the correct answer. The phrasing is just slightly off. A student with a solid grasp of Python would likely be able to eliminate this based on the imprecise wording, even if they weren't fully confident about the correct answer.\n\nTo improve this question, I would suggest replacing distractor 2 with a more clearly incorrect option that cannot be so easily eliminated, perhaps something like:\n\n\"It means that x and 5 are equivalent variables.\"\n\nThis introduces the incorrect concept of \"equivalent variables\" which a student could not eliminate simply based on recognizing that the phrasing around assignment is slightly off.\n\nIn summary, while distractor 1 is reasonable, distractor 2 is too close to the correct answer and could be easily eliminated by a student with a good understanding of Python. Replacing distractor 2 with a more distinctly incorrect option would improve the quality of this multiple-choice question."

This principle can be evaluated as one of the following two options, label the evaluations as options 1 through 2.\n1: There are no obviously wrong options that give away the answer easily\n2: There is at least one option that can be easily eliminated as being incorrect\n\nWhen asked to evaluate a question, return the evaluation key.
