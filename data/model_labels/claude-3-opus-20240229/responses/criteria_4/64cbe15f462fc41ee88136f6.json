The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \"answer choices\" is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \"answer choice\" refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "Let me evaluate this question from the perspective of a student familiar with Python programming.\n\nThe question stem presents a Python code snippet with a runtime error and asks which line number is the source of the error.\n\nTo answer, I'll mentally run through the code:\n\nLine 1 defines the add function, which looks fine. It takes two parameters and has a valid function body.\n\nLine 2 returns the sum of num1 and num2. No issues here.\n\nLine 4 calls the add function, passing in '1' and 2 as arguments, and prints the result. \n\nAha - this is where the error occurs. The add function expects two numbers, but it's being passed a string '1' and a number 2. Adding a string and int in Python throws a TypeError.\n\nSo the correct answer is that the error originates from line 4.\n\nEvaluating the answer choices:\n\n1 - Incorrect. The function definition on line 1 is not the direct cause of the error.\n2 - Incorrect. The return statement on line 2 is not the issue. \n4 - Correct. Passing incompatible types to add() on this line raises the TypeError.\n\nAs a student, I was able to confidently identify the correct answer. The two distractor choices referring to lines 1 and 2 are plausible but can be eliminated with a clear understanding of the code execution.\n\nThe distractors are reasonably good in this case. They refer to lines of code relevant to the function invocation, so a student needs to trace the program execution carefully to rule them out in favor of the correct line 4.\n\nTo improve the distractors slightly, line 2 could be made more tempting by changing it to something like \"return str(num1) + num2\", which would make it seem like a potential type mismatch source to a student less clear on Python's type coercion rules.\n\nBut overall, this is a solid multiple-choice question with appropriate distractors that test code tracing and debugging skills. The correct answer is unambiguous, while the distractors require carefully reasoning about the code to eliminate them."
