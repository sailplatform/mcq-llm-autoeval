The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \"answer choices\" is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \"answer choice\" refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "Let's evaluate this question from the perspective of a student familiar with Python programming.\n\nThe correct answer is \"twice\", as the function returns 2 times the input value x.\n\nNow, let's consider each distractor:\n\n1. \"duplicated_value_of\": This distractor is somewhat plausible, as the function does return a value that is related to the input. However, \"duplicated\" implies creating a copy, which is not quite accurate. A student with a solid understanding of Python might be able to eliminate this choice.\n\n2. \"multiply\": This distractor is quite strong. The function does perform multiplication, so a student who doesn't carefully consider the specific operation (multiplying by 2) might select this choice.\n\n3. \"square\": This distractor is also fairly strong. If a student misinterprets the `2 * x` as `x * x`, they might think the function is squaring the input. However, a careful reading of the code should allow a student to eliminate this choice.\n\nOverall, the distractors in this question are reasonably effective. \"multiply\" and \"square\" are both plausible choices that could trap students who don't read the code carefully or fully understand the operation being performed. \"duplicated_value_of\" is a bit weaker, as it doesn't quite accurately describe the function, but it could still confuse some students.\n\nTo improve the question, \"duplicated_value_of\" could be replaced with a distractor that more closely matches the actual operation, such as \"double\" or \"multiplied_by_two\". This would make all the distractors highly plausible and effective at testing the student's understanding."

This principle can be evaluated as one of the following two options, label the evaluations as options 1 through 2.\n1: There are no obviously wrong options that give away the answer easily\n2: There is at least one option that can be easily eliminated as being incorrect\n\nWhen asked to evaluate a question, return the evaluation key.
