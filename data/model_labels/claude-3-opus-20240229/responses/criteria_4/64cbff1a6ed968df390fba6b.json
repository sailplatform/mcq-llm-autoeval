The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \"answer choices\" is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \"answer choice\" refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "From the perspective of a student familiar with Python programming, I would evaluate the distractors in this multiple-choice question as follows:\n\nDistractor 1: This distractor can be eliminated because it refers to summing the number of chemical elements, which is not what the code is doing. The code is concatenating the names of the elements, not adding their atomic numbers. So this distractor is not very effective.\n\nDistractor 3: This distractor can also be eliminated because the len() function is not being redefined in this code. The built-in len() function is simply being called on element1.name to get the length of the element's name string. Redefining len() is not an example of polymorphism shown here.\n\nDistractor 4: Similar to distractor 3, this option can be ruled out because len() is not being redefined, and the code is not counting chemical elements. The len() call is just getting the length of the name string.\n\nThe correct answer, choice 2, is the only one that cannot be easily eliminated. It correctly identifies that the + operator is being redefined to concatenate the element names or return \"Salt\" for Na + Cl specifically. This is an accurate example of polymorphism.\n\nIn summary, the distractors in this question are not very strong, as 3 out of the 4 choices can be easily eliminated by a student with basic Python knowledge. To improve the question, the incorrect choices should be made more plausible by relating them more closely to the actual polymorphism concept being tested."
