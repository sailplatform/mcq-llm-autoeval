The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "From the perspective of a student familiar with Python programming, I would evaluate the distractors in this multiple-choice question as follows:\n\nDistractor 1: \"matplotlib\"\nThis distractor is a plausible wrong answer. Matplotlib is a widely used Python plotting library, so a student might associate it with numerical operations if they are not deeply familiar with its specific functionality. However, matplotlib is primarily used for data visualization, not efficient numerical computation.\n\nDistractor 2: \"math\" \nThe \"math\" module is also a reasonable distractor. It provides various mathematical functions, so a student might think it could offer an optimized median calculation. However, the math module focuses more on basic mathematical operations and constants, and does not include a built-in median function.\n\nThe correct answer, \"numpy\", is the best choice for efficient numerical computation in Python. NumPy provides highly optimized array operations and mathematical functions, including a dedicated median() function.\n\nOverall, I believe the distractors in this question are effective. They represent Python modules that a student with some familiarity might reasonably consider for the given task, but can be eliminated with a deeper understanding of each module's primary purpose and functionality. The distractors are not obviously incorrect, which makes the question more challenging and better suited to assess the student's knowledge of Python modules for efficient computation."
