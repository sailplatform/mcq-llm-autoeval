The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \"answer choices\" is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \"answer choice\" refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "From the perspective of a student familiar with Python programming, I would evaluate the distractors in this multiple-choice question as follows:\n\nDistractor 1: \"The function will return 'The list is too short!'.\"\nThis distractor is plausible but incorrect. The IndexError exception is raised when trying to access an index that is out of range for the list. However, in this case, the TypeError exception will be raised before reaching the IndexError because the index provided is a string ('two') instead of an integer.\n\nDistractor 2: \"The function will raise an 'IndexError' exception.\"\nThis distractor is also plausible but incorrect. As mentioned above, the TypeError exception will be raised before the IndexError exception can occur. The function will not raise an IndexError in this case.\n\nThe correct answer, \"The function will return 'An integer is required!',\" is the only correct choice, as the TypeError exception will be raised when attempting to access a list element using a string index.\n\nOverall, the distractors are well-constructed and not easily eliminated. They represent common misconceptions or mistakes that a student might make when dealing with exception handling and indexing in Python. The distractors are plausible and require a clear understanding of the order in which exceptions are caught and the specific conditions that trigger each exception.\n\nIn summary, the distractors in this multiple-choice question are effective and contribute to the question's ability to assess the student's understanding of exception handling and indexing in Python."
