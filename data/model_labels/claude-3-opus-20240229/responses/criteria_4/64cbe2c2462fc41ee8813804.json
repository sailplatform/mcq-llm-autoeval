The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

Each item in the warehouse is represented by an SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) number, its name, and the current quantity on hand. You realized that this would be a great scenario to apply object-oriented programming. You decide to create a class named 'Item'. \\n\\n What should be the attributes and methods in your 'Item' class to handle the inventory manage tasks effectively?\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"Attributes: SKU, name, quantity; Methods: add_quantity, reduce_quantity, get_details\",\n            \"correct\": \"true\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"Attributes: SKU, name; Methods: add_Item, delete_Item\",\n            \"correct\": \"false\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"Attributes: SKU, name, price; Methods: calculate_total_price, get_details\",\n            \"correct\": \"false\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nFrom the perspective of a student answering this Multiple-choice question, how good are the distractors?

        "content": "From the perspective of a student familiar with Python programming and object-oriented concepts, I would evaluate the distractors as follows:\n\nDistractor 1: \"Attributes: SKU, name; Methods: add_Item, delete_Item\"\nThis distractor is somewhat plausible but not the best choice. While the attributes SKU and name are relevant for an Item class, the methods add_Item and delete_Item are not ideal. In an inventory management system, you would typically add or remove quantities of existing items rather than adding or deleting the items themselves. This distractor can be eliminated with a good understanding of inventory management concepts.\n\nDistractor 2: \"Attributes: SKU, name, price; Methods: calculate_total_price, get_details\"\nThis distractor is also somewhat plausible but not the best choice. The attributes SKU and name are relevant, but the price attribute may not be necessary for basic inventory management. The calculate_total_price method is not directly related to managing inventory quantities. However, the get_details method is relevant. A student might choose this option if they focus more on general item attributes and methods rather than inventory-specific ones.\n\nThe correct answer, \"Attributes: SKU, name, quantity; Methods: add_quantity, reduce_quantity, get_details\", is the most appropriate choice for an Item class in an inventory management system. It includes the essential attributes (SKU, name, quantity) and methods (add_quantity, reduce_quantity, get_details) for managing inventory effectively.\n\nOverall, the distractors are decent but could be improved. Distractor 1 can be eliminated by students with a good understanding of inventory management concepts, while Distractor 2 might be chosen by students who focus more on general item attributes and methods. To enhance the distractors, they could be made more plausible by including a mix of relevant and irrelevant attributes and methods, making it harder for students to easily eliminate them."
