The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \"answer choices\" is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \"answer choice\" refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "From the perspective of a student familiar with Python programming, I would evaluate the distractors in this multiple-choice question as follows:\n\nDistractor 1: \"Change Line 1 to: `side = float(1.2)`\"\nThis distractor is plausible. While it's not necessary to explicitly convert 1.2 to a float since Python will handle that automatically, a student might think this is required. It's not easily eliminated.\n\nDistractor 2: \"Change Line 1 to: `float(side) = 1.2`\"\nThis distractor is not effective. In Python, you cannot assign a value to a function call like `float(side)`. Most students with basic Python knowledge would quickly identify this as invalid syntax and eliminate it.\n\nDistractor 3: This is the correct answer.\n\nDistractor 4: \"Change Line 1 to: `side_length = 1.2` and Line 2 to: `area = side_length * side_length`\"\nThis distractor is quite plausible. While it unnecessarily changes the variable name and requires modifying two lines instead of one, it would produce the correct result. A student might think this is the best answer if they don't carefully consider the \"changing the code as little as possible\" constraint.\n\nIn summary, Distractor 1 and 4 are effective, but Distractor 2 is weak and easily eliminated. To improve this multiple-choice question, I would suggest replacing Distractor 2 with something more plausible that can't be quickly ruled out by students with basic Python proficiency. The stem and correct answer are clear and appropriate for the concept being assessed."
