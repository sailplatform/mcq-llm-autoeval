The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \"answer choices\" is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \"answer choice\" refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

There must be no incorrect answers that can easily be eliminated.\n"

        "content": "From the perspective of a student familiar with Python programming, I would evaluate the distractors in this multiple-choice question as follows:\n\nDistractor 1: \"used by coders from universities\" - This distractor is not very effective. It can be easily eliminated because the name \"UNICODE\" does not imply any connection to universities specifically. The distractor is not closely related to the correct answer.\n\nDistractor 2: \"honored by the whole universe\" - This distractor is also not very effective. It can be easily eliminated because it anthropomorphizes the UNICODE standard in an unrealistic way. The use of \"universe\" makes it seem grandiose and implausible.\n\nDistractor 3: \"for coding floating-point numbers\" - This distractor is somewhat better than the first two. It relates to coding, so it has some surface plausibility. However, a student with basic familiarity of UNICODE would know it is a character encoding standard, not a numeric one. So this distractor could still be eliminated by process of elimination.\n\nIn summary, the distractors in this question are fairly weak. Distractors 1 and 2 can be easily eliminated, while distractor 3 is only marginally better. To improve the question, the distractors should be more closely related to the correct answer, to make them more challenging to reject for a student with incomplete knowledge of the topic. The distractors should represent common misconceptions or be partially true statements that require more careful analysis to identify as incorrect."

This principle can be evaluated as one of the following two options, label the evaluations as options 1 through 2.\n1: There are no obviously wrong options that give away the answer easily\n2: There is at least one option that can be easily eliminated as being incorrect\n\nWhen asked to evaluate a question, return the evaluation key.
