The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \"answer choices\" is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \"answer choice\" refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "Let me first try to answer the question as a student familiar with Python programming.\n\nThe correct answer is range(1, 11). This will generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to 10 (inclusive) that the for loop will iterate over.\n\nNow let me evaluate the distractors:\n\nrange(10) is a plausible distractor. It generates a sequence from 0 to 9, which is close to the desired sequence but doesn't include 10. A student who isn't careful about off-by-one errors might select this.\n\nrange(0, 10) is also a plausible distractor. It generates a sequence from 0 to 9, same as range(10). A student needs to remember that the stop value in range() is exclusive to eliminate this choice.\n\nFrom a student's perspective, all the answer choices look quite similar and plausible. There are no obviously incorrect distractors that can be easily eliminated. A student really needs to think through how the range() function works to select the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, I would say the distractors in this multiple-choice question are well-designed. They test the student's precise understanding of the range() function and off-by-one errors, which are common points of confusion. The distractors cannot be easily ruled out without a solid grasp of the concepts being tested."

This principle can be evaluated as one of the following two options, label the evaluations as options 1 through 2.\n1: There are no obviously wrong options that give away the answer easily\n2: There is at least one option that can be easily eliminated as being incorrect\n\nWhen asked to evaluate a question, return the evaluation key.
