The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \"answer choices\" is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \"answer choice\" refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

There must be no incorrect answers that can easily be eliminated.\n"

        "content": "From the perspective of a student familiar with Python programming, I would evaluate the distractors in this multiple-choice question as follows:\n\nThe correct answer, \"access a super class's attributes and/or methods\", accurately describes the purpose of the super() function in Python.\n\nDistractor 1: \"make a class super\" is not a great distractor. While it uses the word \"super\" which is related to the topic, the phrase \"make a class super\" doesn't have a clear meaning in Python. A student with a basic understanding of Python classes and inheritance would likely be able to eliminate this as an incorrect answer choice.\n\nDistractor 2: \"make a class better\" is also a weak distractor. It is vague and doesn't relate directly to the functionality of super() or to Python classes and inheritance. A student could easily eliminate this choice as well, even without a thorough understanding of the super() function.\n\nTo improve these distractors, I would recommend making them more plausible and closely related to the topic of Python classes, inheritance, and the super() function. For example:\n\n- \"call a method from the current class\" - This is related to classes and methods, but not the specific functionality of super().\n- \"initialize attributes in the current class\" - This relates to classes and attributes, but again doesn't capture the purpose of super().\n\nBy crafting distractors that are more closely related to the topic and could potentially be confused for the correct answer, the question would better assess a student's depth of understanding of the super() function and its role in Python class inheritance."

This principle can be evaluated as one of the following two options, label the evaluations as options 1 through 2.\n1: There are no obviously wrong options that give away the answer easily\n2: There is at least one option that can be easily eliminated as being incorrect\n\nWhen asked to evaluate a question, return the evaluation key.
