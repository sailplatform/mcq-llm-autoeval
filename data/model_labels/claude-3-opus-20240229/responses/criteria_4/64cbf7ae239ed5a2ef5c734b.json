The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "Let me first try answering the question as a student familiar with Python:\n\nThe correct answer is 'Hello!'. When outer_function() is called, it assigns the string 'Hello!' to the variable outer_value. Then it defines an inner function inner_function() which, if called, would assign the string 'Goodbye!' to its own local variable also named outer_value. However, this local outer_value in inner_function() is separate from the outer_value in outer_function(). \n\nWhen inner_function() is called inside outer_function(), it assigns 'Goodbye!' to its local outer_value, but that doesn't affect the outer_value in outer_function(). Finally, outer_function() prints the value of its outer_value, which is still 'Hello!'.\n\nNow let me evaluate the distractors:\n\nDistractor 1: \"'Goodbye!'\" \nThis is a plausible distractor. A student might think calling inner_function() will change the value of outer_value in outer_function() to 'Goodbye!'. But actually inner_function() has its own separate outer_value variable. So this distractor tests understanding of variable scope.\n\nDistractor 2: \"The program throws a NameError.\"\nThis is also a decent distractor. A student might think outer_value in inner_function() is not defined since it's not passed in as an argument. But outer_value in inner_function() is a separate local variable, so no NameError is thrown. This tests understanding of how Python handles variables.\n\nIn summary, both distractors are quite good. They are plausible incorrect answers that test specific aspects of how variable scope and naming works in Python. A student needs solid understanding of the concepts to eliminate them. I don't see any obviously wrong distractors that are easily eliminated.\n\nSo in terms of distractor quality, I'd rate this as a strong multiple-choice question. The distractors are effective at identifying students who don't fully grasp variable scope and naming in Python."
