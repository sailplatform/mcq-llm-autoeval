The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \"answer choices\" is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \"answer choice\" refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "Let me evaluate this question from the perspective of a student familiar with Python programming.\n\nThe correct answer is: \"Bubble-sort algorithm does comparisons and swaps until the list is sorted.\" This accurately describes the key characteristic of the bubble sort algorithm.\n\nAnalyzing the distractors:\n\n1. \"Bubble-sort algorithm sorts the list by swapping elements in pairs from beginning to end of list in one pass.\"\n   This distractor is plausible because the bubble sort algorithm does involve swapping adjacent elements. However, it is incorrect because the algorithm requires multiple passes through the list, not just one pass, to fully sort the list.\n\n2. \"Bubble-sort algorithm sorts the list in one complete single pass without multiple iterations.\"\n   This distractor is also plausible because it mentions sorting the list in a single pass, which might seem appealing to a student who is not fully familiar with the bubble sort algorithm. However, it is incorrect because the bubble sort algorithm requires multiple iterations (passes) through the list to fully sort it.\n\nEvaluation:\nThe distractors in this multiple-choice question are well-constructed. They are plausible and not easily eliminated by a student who has a basic understanding of the bubble sort algorithm. The distractors focus on the number of passes required to sort the list, which is a key aspect of the bubble sort algorithm.\n\nA student who is not thoroughly familiar with the bubble sort algorithm might be tempted to choose one of the distractors, especially if they have a misconception about the number of passes required.\n\nIn summary, the distractors in this multiple-choice question are effective and cannot be easily eliminated by a student who is familiar with Python programming but may not have a deep understanding of the bubble sort algorithm."

This principle can be evaluated as one of the following two options, label the evaluations as options 1 through 2.\n1: There are no obviously wrong options that give away the answer easily\n2: There is at least one option that can be easily eliminated as being incorrect\n\nWhen asked to evaluate a question, return the evaluation key.
