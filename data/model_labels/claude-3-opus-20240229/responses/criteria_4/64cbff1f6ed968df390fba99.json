The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "From the perspective of a student familiar with Python programming, I would evaluate this multiple-choice question as follows:\n\nThe question stem is clear and focused on a specific Python concept - comparing a string and an integer using the equality operator (==). This tests the student's understanding of data types and comparison operators.\n\nWhen I try to answer the question, I reason that the expression \"5\" == 5 will evaluate to False, because the string \"5\" is not equal to the integer 5. They are different data types.\n\nLooking at the answer choices, I see:\n1. False (marked as the correct answer)\n2. True\n\nAs a student, I would not be able to easily eliminate either of the answer choices, as they are both plausible. If I did not have a solid grasp of data types and comparisons, I might think the expression would evaluate to True since both operands are \"5\".\n\nHowever, there is an issue with the distractors in this question. The JSON only provides one distractor (True), while a proper multiple-choice question should have two distractors and one correct answer. The question is missing a second distractor.\n\nIn summary, while the existing distractor is effective and not easily eliminated, the question is flawed due to the missing second distractor. This needs to be corrected for the multiple-choice question to be complete and valid."

This principle can be evaluated as one of the following two options, label the evaluations as options 1 through 2.\n1: There are no obviously wrong options that give away the answer easily\n2: There is at least one option that can be easily eliminated as being incorrect\n\nWhen asked to evaluate a question, return the evaluation key.
