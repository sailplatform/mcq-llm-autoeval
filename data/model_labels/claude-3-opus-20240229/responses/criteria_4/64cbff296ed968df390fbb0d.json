The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \"answer choices\" is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \"answer choice\" refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "Let me first try to answer the question as a student familiar with Python:\n\nThe code will first print the slice of 'Ohio' from index 1 to 3 (exclusive), which is 'hi'. \n\nThen it will print the slice of 'Northern Mariana Islands' from index 3 to 7 (exclusive), which is 'ther', concatenated with the last character of 'Maine', which is 'e'.\n\nSo the output will be:\nhi\nthere\n\nEvaluating the distractors:\n\n1. \"Oh\\nMaine\" - This could be tempting if the student mistakenly thinks the first letter of 'Ohio' is used instead of the slice. The 'Maine' part also makes it seem plausible. It's a fairly good distractor.\n\n2. \"Oh\\nNorth\" - Similar to the previous one, but uses 'North' instead of 'Maine'. This is less plausible because 'North' doesn't appear as is in the original places list. A student might be able to eliminate this one.\n\n3. \"hi\\nthen\" - This one has the correct first part 'hi', but the second part 'then' doesn't match the slice that is taken from 'Northern Mariana Islands'. A careful student could eliminate this.\n\nOverall, distractor 1 is quite good, but distractors 2 and 3 could potentially be eliminated by a student who carefully traces the code. It would be better if all the distractors were equally plausible and not easily eliminated. Perhaps distractor 3 could be changed to something like \"hi\\nthern\" to make it harder to eliminate."
