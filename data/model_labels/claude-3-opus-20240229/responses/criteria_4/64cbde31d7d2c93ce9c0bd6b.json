The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \"answer choices\" is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \"answer choice\" refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "Let me first try to answer this question as a student familiar with Python programming:\n\nThe most appropriate type of loop to execute a block of code a predetermined number of times is a for loop. A while loop is used when you want to repeat a block of code as long as a certain condition is true, but the number of iterations is not known in advance. Python does not have an \"until loop\".\n\nSo the correct answer is \"For loop\".\n\nNow, evaluating the distractors from a student's perspective:\n\n1. \"While loop\" is a plausible distractor. While loops are used for looping in Python, but they are more appropriate when the number of iterations is not known in advance. A student who doesn't fully understand the difference between for and while loops might select this.\n\n2. \"Until loop\" is not a good distractor. Python does not have an \"until loop\", so a student with even basic familiarity with Python would easily eliminate this choice.\n\nIn summary, one distractor (\"While loop\") is effective as it represents a common misconception or confusion. However, the other distractor (\"Until loop\") is too easily eliminated by anyone with basic Python knowledge.\n\nTo improve this question, I would suggest replacing \"Until loop\" with a more plausible distractor, such as \"Recursive function call\", which is another way to repeat code execution in Python, although not actually a type of loop."

This principle can be evaluated as one of the following two options, label the evaluations as options 1 through 2.\n1: There are no obviously wrong options that give away the answer easily\n2: There is at least one option that can be easily eliminated as being incorrect\n\nWhen asked to evaluate a question, return the evaluation key.
