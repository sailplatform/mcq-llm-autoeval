The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \"answer choices\" is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \"answer choice\" refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "Let me evaluate this multiple-choice question from the perspective of a student familiar with Python:\n\nThe stem presents a code snippet that takes user input using the input() function, stores it in the user_input variable, and then prints a message along with the user_input value.\n\nNow, let's look at the answer choices:\n\n1. \"The number you entered is:  10\" - This looks like the correct answer because it matches the expected output format based on the print statement in the code.\n\n2. \"10\" - This is a plausible distractor. If a student misunderstands the print statement and thinks it will only output the user input value, they might select this option.\n\n3. \"The number you entered is: 10\" - This is also a plausible distractor. It is very similar to the correct answer but lacks the extra space after the colon. A student who doesn't pay close attention to the print statement might select this option.\n\nEvaluation:\nThe distractors in this multiple-choice question are well-constructed. Both distractors are plausible and cannot be easily eliminated by a student who understands the concept being tested. The distractors are based on common misunderstandings or oversights that students might make when interpreting the code snippet.\n\nDistractor 2 tests whether the student understands that the print statement includes both a message and the user input value.\nDistractor 3 tests the student's attention to detail regarding the exact spacing in the output.\n\nTherefore, from the perspective of a student answering this question, the distractors are effective and contribute to the overall quality of the multiple-choice question."

This principle can be evaluated as one of the following two options, label the evaluations as options 1 through 2.\n1: There are no obviously wrong options that give away the answer easily\n2: There is at least one option that can be easily eliminated as being incorrect\n\nWhen asked to evaluate a question, return the evaluation key.
