The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \"answer choices\" is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \"answer choice\" refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "From the perspective of a student familiar with Python programming, I would evaluate the distractors in this multiple-choice question as follows:\n\nDistractor 1: \"low-level feature set\"\nThis distractor is effective. While Python is known for its simplicity and high-level abstractions, a student who is not very familiar with Python's characteristics might believe that Python's popularity in data science is due to low-level features. It is not immediately obvious that this is an incorrect answer.\n\nDistractor 2: \"web development capabilities\" \nThis distractor is somewhat weak. Although Python is used for web development (with frameworks like Django and Flask), it is not the primary reason for its widespread use in data science. A student with a basic understanding of Python's strengths might be able to eliminate this distractor more easily.\n\nOverall, the distractors are of mixed quality. Distractor 1 is effective and not easily eliminated, while Distractor 2 is less effective and could potentially be ruled out by students with a basic knowledge of Python's primary strengths and applications. To improve the question, Distractor 2 could be replaced with a more plausible option that is harder to eliminate, such as \"speed of execution\" or \"built-in support for data visualization\"."

This principle can be evaluated as one of the following two options, label the evaluations as options 1 through 2.\n1: There are no obviously wrong options that give away the answer easily\n2: There is at least one option that can be easily eliminated as being incorrect\n\nWhen asked to evaluate a question, return the evaluation key.
