The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \"answer choices\" is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \"answer choice\" refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "Let me evaluate this question from the perspective of a student familiar with Python programming.\n\nThe stem provides a Python import statement and asks what it causes to be imported. To answer, I need to understand the syntax of Python import statements.\n\nLooking at the answer choices:\n\nA) entity `c` from module `b` from package `a` - This matches the import statement syntax in the stem. The `from a.b` part specifies the package `a` and module `b`, and `import c` specifies the entity `c` being imported from that module.\n\nB) entity `a` from module `b` from package `c` - This reverses the order compared to the import statement. It would be `from c.b import a` to match this.\n\nC) entity `c` from module `a` from package `b` - This also switches the package and module around compared to the import statement.\n\nD) entity `b` from module `a` from package `c` - This changes all parts - the entity, module and package don't match the import statement.\n\nAs a student, I can confidently eliminate B, C and D because they don't match the straightforward syntax of the import statement provided. A is the only answer choice that correctly reflects what the statement imports.\n\nThe distractors are not very strong, as they can easily be ruled out just by carefully reading the import statement syntax and comparing it to the answer choices. The distractors simply rearrange the parts (entity, module, package), making it clear they are incorrect to anyone with a basic understanding of Python import statements.\n\nTo improve, the distractors need to be more subtle and plausible, perhaps using real Python package/module names or more closely matching the original syntax. They should require a deeper understanding of imports to eliminate, rather than just surface reading of the statement."

This principle can be evaluated as one of the following two options, label the evaluations as options 1 through 2.\n1: There are no obviously wrong options that give away the answer easily\n2: There is at least one option that can be easily eliminated as being incorrect\n\nWhen asked to evaluate a question, return the evaluation key.
