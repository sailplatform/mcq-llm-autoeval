The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \"answer choices\" is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \"answer choice\" refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "From the perspective of a student familiar with Python programming, I would evaluate the distractors in this multiple-choice question as follows:\n\nDistractor 1: \"unused_variable\"\nThis distractor is plausible. While the variable name \"unused_variable\" would work syntactically to create a variable holding the string 'Hello World!', it is not an ideal variable name since it implies the variable will not be used later in the program. However, a student who is still learning about variable naming conventions might consider this a viable option.\n\nDistractor 2: \"len\" \nThis distractor is not as strong. \"len\" is a built-in Python function used to determine the length of an object, such as a string or list. Assigning a string to the variable name \"len\" would override this built-in functionality, which is generally discouraged. Most students with a basic understanding of Python would likely recognize \"len\" as a reserved keyword and eliminate this distractor.\n\nOverall, while the \"unused_variable\" distractor is reasonably plausible, the \"len\" distractor could likely be eliminated by most students with foundational Python knowledge. To improve this multiple-choice question, I would suggest replacing the \"len\" distractor with a more plausible variable name that doesn't override built-in Python functionality, such as:\n\n{\n    \"choice\": \"greeting\",\n    \"correct\": \"false\"\n}\n\nThis would provide two distractors that are syntactically valid and plausible variable names, making the question more challenging for students to answer."

This principle can be evaluated as one of the following two options, label the evaluations as options 1 through 2.\n1: There are no obviously wrong options that give away the answer easily\n2: There is at least one option that can be easily eliminated as being incorrect\n\nWhen asked to evaluate a question, return the evaluation key.
