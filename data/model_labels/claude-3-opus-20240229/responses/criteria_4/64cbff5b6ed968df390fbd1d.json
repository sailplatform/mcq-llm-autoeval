The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \"answer choices\" is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \"answer choice\" refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "From the perspective of a student familiar with Python programming, the distractors in this multiple-choice question are effective. Here's why:\n\n1. The correct answer, \"raised\", is a term commonly used when discussing exceptions in Python. It accurately describes what happens when an exception occurs.\n\n2. The first distractor, \"thrown\", is a plausible incorrect answer because it is a term used in some other programming languages, such as Java, to describe the same concept. A student who is not well-versed in Python-specific terminology might be tempted to choose this option.\n\n3. The second distractor, \"dropped\", is also a plausible incorrect answer. While it is not a term typically associated with exceptions in programming, it could be interpreted as something that happens unexpectedly or accidentally, which might lead a student to select it if they are unsure about the correct terminology.\n\nBoth distractors are plausible and cannot be easily eliminated by a student who is not confident about the specific terminology used in Python for exception handling. The distractors are also homogeneous and parallel in format, as they are all single words that could potentially describe what happens when an exception occurs.\n\nOverall, the distractors in this multiple-choice question are well-constructed and effectively serve their purpose of distinguishing between students who have a solid understanding of Python's exception handling terminology and those who do not."

This principle can be evaluated as one of the following two options, label the evaluations as options 1 through 2.\n1: There are no obviously wrong options that give away the answer easily\n2: There is at least one option that can be easily eliminated as being incorrect\n\nWhen asked to evaluate a question, return the evaluation key.
