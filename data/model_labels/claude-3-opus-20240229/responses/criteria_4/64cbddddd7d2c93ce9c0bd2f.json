The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \"answer choices\" is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \"answer choice\" refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "Let me first try to answer the question as a student familiar with Python programming.\n\nThe question provides a function `greeting` that takes a parameter `name` and returns a string that concatenates 'Hello, ' with the `name` parameter. In the `print` statement, the function is called with the argument `1234`, which is an integer.\n\nIn Python, concatenating a string with an integer will raise a `TypeError` because it's not possible to directly concatenate different data types. The correct way would be to convert the integer to a string first.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is: \"TypeError: can only concatenate str (not \"int\") to str\".\n\nNow, evaluating the distractors:\n\n1. \"Hello, 1234\" - This distractor is plausible if the student doesn't understand that concatenating a string with an integer directly is not allowed in Python. A student might think the integer will be automatically converted to a string.\n\n2. \"1234\" - This distractor is less plausible. It suggests that the function would simply return the input argument, ignoring the 'Hello, ' concatenation. A student with a basic understanding of Python functions would likely recognize that this is incorrect.\n\nOverall, I think the first distractor is quite good, as it represents a common misconception about string concatenation in Python. The second distractor, however, is weaker and could potentially be eliminated by most students with a basic grasp of Python.\n\nTo improve the second distractor, I might suggest something like: \"Hello, <built-in function int>\" - This would represent the output if the `str()` function was used to convert the integer to a string, but the conversion was done incorrectly.\n\nIn summary, the distractors are of mixed quality. One is quite strong, while the other could be improved to be more plausible."

This principle can be evaluated as one of the following two options, label the evaluations as options 1 through 2.\n1: There are no obviously wrong options that give away the answer easily\n2: There is at least one option that can be easily eliminated as being incorrect\n\nWhen asked to evaluate a question, return the evaluation key.
