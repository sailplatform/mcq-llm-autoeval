The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \"answer choices\" is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \"answer choice\" refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

A high school student asks you this question: 'I have collected data for the last six months on different species of insects found in a particular area. For each month, I have the number of total specie identified, total insect population and the most dominating specie. I want to make a line graph for the six months, but all three values in one line graph is confusing. How should I adjust the graph?'\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"Plot all data points in one line graph without any differentiation.\",\n            \"correct\": \"false\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"Use a line graph only for the number of total species identified each month, a separate bar chart for total insect population every month, and a pie chart representing the most dominating specie each month.\",\n            \"correct\": \"true\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"Use only one type of graph (line, pie or bar) for all three data points.\",\n            \"correct\": \"false\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nFrom the perspective of a student answering this Multiple-choice question, how good are the distractors? There must be no incorrect answers that can easily be eliminated.\n"

        "content": "From the perspective of a student familiar with data visualization techniques, I would evaluate the distractors in this multiple-choice question as follows:\n\nDistractor 1: \"Plot all data points in one line graph without any differentiation.\" \nThis distractor is plausible because it suggests putting all the data into one graph, which the question stem mentions as being confusing. A student who is unsure about best practices for visualizing different types of data might think this is a viable option.\n\nDistractor 2: \"Use only one type of graph (line, pie or bar) for all three data points.\"\nThis distractor is also plausible. The question stem mentions using a line graph, so a student might think sticking to one graph type is preferable for consistency. However, using the same graph type for all three different data points is not ideal.\n\nBoth distractors present options that are plausible for a student who is still learning about data visualization best practices. Neither distractor can be easily eliminated, as they both relate directly to the question stem and represent common misconceptions or suboptimal approaches.\n\nThe correct answer appropriately suggests using different visualization types suitable for each data point - a line graph for the trend of total species over time, a bar chart to compare insect populations, and a pie chart to show the composition of the most dominant species per month.\n\nIn summary, the distractors in this multiple-choice question are effective. They are plausible and not easily eliminated, requiring the student to think critically about the best way to visualize the different types of data presented in the question stem."
