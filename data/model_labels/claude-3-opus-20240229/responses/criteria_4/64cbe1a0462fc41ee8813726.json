The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "From the perspective of a student familiar with Python programming, I would evaluate the distractors in this multiple-choice question as follows:\n\nDistractor 1: \"Function 1: Calculates the average temperature and returns the value. Function 2: Prints the calculated average temperature.\"\nThis distractor is reasonably good. Both functions described are plausible and relate to the stem's context. Function 1 returns a value, while Function 2 has a side-effect of printing. However, a discerning student might recognize that the question is asking for the opposite arrangement.\n\nDistractor 2: \"Function 1: Calculates and prints the average temperature as well as some descriptive statistics of the temperature data. Function 2: Calculates the average temperature and returns the value.\"\nThis distractor is also fairly good. Function 1 has side-effects (printing and calculating statistics), while Function 2 returns a value. It aligns with the stem but in the opposite arrangement compared to the correct answer.\n\nBoth distractors are relevant to the question and cannot be easily eliminated by a student with Python knowledge. They require careful reading and understanding of the concepts of returning values versus side-effects in functions.\n\nIn summary, the distractors in this multiple-choice question are well-constructed. They are not obviously incorrect and would require a student to thoughtfully consider the differences between returning values and causing side-effects with functions in Python. The distractors effectively serve their purpose of distinguishing students with a solid grasp of the concept from those without."
