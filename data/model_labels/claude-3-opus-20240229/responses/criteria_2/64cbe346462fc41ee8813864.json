The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem and adheres to the following properties.\n1. A distractor should not be obviously wrong. In other words, it must still bear relations to the stem and correct answer. \n2. A distractor should be phrased positively and be a true statement that does not correctly answer the stem, all while giving no clues towards the correct answer.\n3. Although a distractor is incorrect, it must be plausible: in other words, it must be positioned such that a student who does not fully grasp the topic may believe that the distractor is the correct answer choice. Later provided with the topic and context students will be assessed on is a list of common misconceptions within that topic. \n4. A distractor must be incorrect. It cannot be correct, or interpreted as correct by someone who strongly grasps the topic.\n\nThe term \"answer choices\" is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \"answer choice\" refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\n\n"

The answer key is also correct.\n\nThe correct answer is: \"HTML has a fixed set of tags, while XML allows the use of custom tags.\"\n\nThis statement accurately describes the key difference between HTML and XML:\n\n1. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language used for creating web pages and has a predefined set of tags that browsers understand and use to render the content.\n\n2. XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a markup language designed to store and transport data. It allows users to define their own custom tags, making it more flexible and adaptable to various applications.\n\nThe other two options are incorrect:\n\n1. \"HTML is used to store and transport data, while XML is used to format and display data.\" - This statement is false because HTML is used for formatting and displaying data on web pages, while XML is used for storing and transporting data.\n\n2. \"XML is used to design websites, while HTML is used to describe data.\" - This statement is also false because HTML, not XML, is primarily used for designing websites, and XML is used to describe and structure data, not HTML.\n\nTherefore, the answer key correctly identifies the factually correct answer among the given options."

This principle can be evaluated as one of the following four options, label the evaluations as options 1 through 4.\n\n1: There is a correct answer and it is marked correct\n2: There is a correct answer but it is not marked correct\n3: There are multiple correct answers\n4: There is no correct answer\n\nWhen asked to evaluate a question, return the evaluation key.
