The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem and adheres to the following properties.\n1. A distractor should not be obviously wrong. In other words, it must still bear relations to the stem and correct answer. \n2. A distractor should be phrased positively and be a true statement that does not correctly answer the stem, all while giving no clues towards the correct answer.\n3. Although a distractor is incorrect, it must be plausible: in other words, it must be positioned such that a student who does not fully grasp the topic may believe that the distractor is the correct answer choice. Later provided with the topic and context students will be assessed on is a list of common misconceptions within that topic. \n4. A distractor must be incorrect. It cannot be correct, or interpreted as correct by someone who strongly grasps the topic.\n\nThe term \"answer choices\" is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \"answer choice\" refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\n\n"

        "content": "Yes, there is a factually correct answer to the question listed among the options, and the answer key is correct.\n\nThe code checks three conditions:\n\n1. `usable`: Checks if the dictionary `statistics` contains all the necessary keys ('sample_size', 'mean', 'median', 'standard_deviation'). This condition is True.\n\n2. `stable_statistics`: Checks if the sample size is greater than 30, which is considered large enough for stable statistics. In this case, the sample size is 200, so this condition is also True.\n\n3. `symmetric_distribution`: Checks if the absolute difference between the mean and median is less than 0.1 times the standard deviation, suggesting a symmetric distribution. Here, the difference is 0.2 (5.2 - 5.0), which is less than 0.12 (0.1 * 1.2), so this condition is True as well.\n\nSince all three conditions are True, the output of the program will be True.\n\nAmong the given options, the choice \"True\" is marked as the correct answer, which aligns with the expected output of the program. Therefore, the answer key is correct."
