The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem and adheres to the following properties.\n1. A distractor should not be obviously wrong. In other words, it must still bear relations to the stem and correct answer. \n2. A distractor should be phrased positively and be a true statement that does not correctly answer the stem, all while giving no clues towards the correct answer.\n3. Although a distractor is incorrect, it must be plausible: in other words, it must be positioned such that a student who does not fully grasp the topic may believe that the distractor is the correct answer choice. Later provided with the topic and context students will be assessed on is a list of common misconceptions within that topic. \n4. A distractor must be incorrect. It cannot be correct, or interpreted as correct by someone who strongly grasps the topic.\n\nThe term \"answer choices\" is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \"answer choice\" refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\n\n"

        "content": "Yes, there is a factually correct answer to the question listed among the options. The answer key is also correct.\n\nThe correct answer is \"character, character\". This will properly iterate over each character in the string, and check if that character is equal to 'n', incrementing the count if so.\n\nThe first distractor \"i, string[i]\" is incorrect because 'i' is not defined in this context. Indexing into the string with string[i] would be the correct way to access individual characters if iterating using index values, but here we are iterating directly over the characters.\n\nThe second distractor \"character, character\" is the same as the correct answer, making it an invalid distractor. There should only be one correct answer among the choices.\n\nSo in summary, the question stem and correct answer are valid and the answer key is accurate. However, the distractors need improvement - the first should be a valid but incorrect option, and the second should be changed to something different than the correct answer."

This principle can be evaluated as one of the following four options, label the evaluations as options 1 through 4.\n\n1: There is a correct answer and it is marked correct\n2: There is a correct answer but it is not marked correct\n3: There are multiple correct answers\n4: There is no correct answer\n\nWhen asked to evaluate a question, return the evaluation key.
