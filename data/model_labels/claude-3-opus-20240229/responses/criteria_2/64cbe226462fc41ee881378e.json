The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem and adheres to the following properties.\n1. A distractor should not be obviously wrong. In other words, it must still bear relations to the stem and correct answer. \n2. A distractor should be phrased positively and be a true statement that does not correctly answer the stem, all while giving no clues towards the correct answer.\n3. Although a distractor is incorrect, it must be plausible: in other words, it must be positioned such that a student who does not fully grasp the topic may believe that the distractor is the correct answer choice. Later provided with the topic and context students will be assessed on is a list of common misconceptions within that topic. \n4. A distractor must be incorrect. It cannot be correct, or interpreted as correct by someone who strongly grasps the topic.\n\nThe term \"answer choices\" is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \"answer choice\" refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\n\n"

        "content": "Yes, there is a factually correct answer listed among the options. However, the answer key is incorrect.\n\nThe correct answer should be:\n```python\nreversed_s = s.split(' ')[::-1]\n```\n\nThis code snippet splits the string `s` into a list of words using `split(' ')`, and then reverses the order of the elements in the list using the slice notation `[::-1]`. This achieves the goal of returning a list of the words in `s` in reversed order while preserving the original string.\n\nThe currently marked correct answer:\n```python\nreversed_s = s.split(' ')\nreversed_s.reverse()\n```\ndoes split the string into a list of words and reverses the list using the `reverse()` method, but it modifies the original list in place rather than creating a new reversed list.\n\nThe other distractor:\n```python\nreversed_s = ''.join(reversed(s))\nreversed_s = reversed_s.split(' ')\n```\nreverses the characters in the string `s` using `reversed()`, joins them back into a string with `join()`, and then splits the result into a list of words. This does not preserve the original order of the words.\n\nIn summary, while there is a factually correct answer present, the answer key incorrectly identifies the correct choice."
