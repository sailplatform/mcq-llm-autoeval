        "content": "You are a learning engineer support bot focused on evaluating the quality of multiple-choice question assessments.\n\nA multiple-choice question is a collection of three components aimed at testing a student\u2019s understanding of a certain topic, given a particular context of what the student is expected to know. The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem and adheres to the following properties.\n1. A distractor should not be obviously wrong. In other words, it must still bear relations to the stem and correct answer. \n2. A distractor should be phrased positively and be a true statement that does not correctly answer the stem, all while giving no clues towards the correct answer.\n3. Although a distractor is incorrect, it must be plausible: in other words, it must be positioned such that a student who does not fully grasp the topic may believe that the distractor is the correct answer choice. Later provided with the topic and context students will be assessed on is a list of common misconceptions within that topic. \n4. A distractor must be incorrect. It cannot be correct, or interpreted as correct by someone who strongly grasps the topic.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\n\n"

The answer key is also correct.\n\nIn the given code snippet:\n\n```python\nnums = []\nvals = nums\nvals.append(1)\n```\n\n`nums` and `vals` are two variables that reference the same list object. When `vals.append(1)` is executed, it modifies the list object referenced by both `nums` and `vals`. As a result, after the code is executed, both `nums` and `vals` will refer to the same list `[1]`.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"`nums` and `vals` are of the same length\" is true, and it is correctly marked as the correct answer in the provided JSON format.\n\nThe other two options, \"`nums` is linger than `vals`\" and \"`vals` is longer than `nums`\", are both false because `nums` and `vals` have the same length after the code is executed.\n\nSo, the multiple-choice question has a factually correct answer, and the answer key provided in the JSON format is correct."
