The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "The distractors in this multiple-choice question are quite good. Both distractors are plausible answers for someone who is not fully familiar with Python's list sorting methods.\n\nThe first distractor, `numbers.reverse()`, could be chosen by a student who knows that `reverse()` can be used to reverse the order of a list, but may not realize that it doesn't sort the list first.\n\nThe second distractor, `sorted(numbers, reverse=True)`, is a very good distractor. It's a correct way to sort a list in descending order in Python, but it doesn't modify the original list, it returns a new sorted list. This could be a correct answer depending on the context of the question, but given the question's wording, it's considered incorrect because it doesn't \"sort the list\", it creates a new sorted list.\n\nSo, both distractors are plausible incorrect answers that cannot be easily eliminated, making this a high-quality multiple-choice question."

This principle can be evaluated as one of the following two options, label the evaluations as options 1 through 2.\n1: There are no obviously wrong options that give away the answer easily\n2: There is at least one option that can be easily eliminated as being incorrect\n\nWhen asked to evaluate a question, return the evaluation key.
