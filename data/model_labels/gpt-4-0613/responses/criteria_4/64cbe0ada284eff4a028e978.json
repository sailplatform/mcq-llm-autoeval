The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "The distractors in this multiple-choice question are well-crafted and cannot be easily eliminated. \n\nThe first distractor uses a list comprehension instead of a generator expression, which is a common mistake that students might make. This distractor is plausible because it correctly uses the reduce function to calculate the factorial, but it does not meet the requirement of the question to use a generator expression.\n\nThe second distractor also uses a list comprehension and calls a factorial function that is not defined in the question. This distractor is plausible because it might seem like a correct answer to students who are not familiar with the difference between list comprehensions and generator expressions, or who do not notice that the factorial function is not defined.\n\nBoth distractors are similar in length and structure to the correct answer, which makes them even more plausible. Therefore, this question is well-designed and would be effective at testing a student's understanding of Python generators and generator expressions."
