The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "The distractors in this multiple-choice question are well designed and cannot be easily eliminated. \n\nMethod 1 is incorrect because it calls the `swim()` method before setting the speed (`dx`) to 0. However, the `swim()` method is not defined in the class, and even if it was, it would not make sense to call it before stopping the fish.\n\nMethod 2 is incorrect because it does not include the `self` parameter, which is necessary for instance methods in Python. This distractor is good because it tests the student's understanding of Python's object-oriented programming.\n\nMethod 3 is incorrect because it includes unnecessary code. While it correctly includes the `self` parameter and sets the speed (`dx`) to 0, it also includes a loop that calls the `swim()` method a certain number of times. This is unnecessary for a `stop()` method and could confuse students who do not have a solid understanding of Python's object-oriented programming.\n\nMethod 4 is the correct answer because it simply sets the speed (`dx`) to 0, effectively stopping the fish.\n\nOverall, the distractors are effective in testing the student's understanding of Python's object-oriented programming and the specific task of adding a method to a class."
