The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "The distractors in this multiple-choice question are well designed. They are all plausible answers for someone who is not familiar with the `ord` and `chr` functions in Python. \n\nThe `ord` function returns an integer representing the Unicode character, and the `chr` function returns a string representing a character whose Unicode code point is the integer. In this case, 'z' is being converted to its Unicode integer, subtracted by 2, and then converted back to a character, which results in 'x'. \n\nThe distractors 'y' and 'z' could be chosen by a student who does not understand the `ord` and `chr` functions or the arithmetic operation involved. The distractor 'a' could be chosen by a student who thinks the operation wraps around to the start of the alphabet. \n\nTherefore, none of the distractors can be easily eliminated without understanding the Python code, making this a good multiple-choice question."
