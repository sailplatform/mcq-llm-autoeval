The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

They all seem plausible if the student does not fully understand how string slicing and list operations work in Python. \n\nThe first distractor \"`Oh\\\\nMaine`\" could be chosen by a student who misunderstands the slicing indices or the order of the operations. \n\nThe second distractor \"`Oh\\\\nNorth`\" could be chosen by a student who doesn't realize that the 'pop' operation removes the last element from the list 'places', and thus changes the index of 'Maine'. \n\nThe third distractor \"`hi\\\\nthen`\" could be chosen by a student who doesn't understand that the slicing operation `places[1][3:7]` will result in 'ther' and not 'then'. \n\nTherefore, none of the distractors can be easily eliminated without a solid understanding of the Python code in the question."
