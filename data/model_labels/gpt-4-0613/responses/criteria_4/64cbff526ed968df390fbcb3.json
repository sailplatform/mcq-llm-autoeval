The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "The distractors in this multiple-choice question are well designed and cannot be easily eliminated. \n\nThe first distractor \"`A.__init__()`\" might seem correct at first glance, but it lacks the `self` argument which is necessary when calling a method from a superclass in Python.\n\nThe second distractor \"`A.__init__(1)`\" is also a good distractor because it includes an argument, but it's the wrong argument. Instead of `self`, it incorrectly uses `1`.\n\nThe third distractor \"`__init__()`\" could be misleading for students who might think that calling the `__init__` method without specifying the class or including the `self` argument is correct.\n\nThe correct answer \"`A.__init__(self)`\" is the only choice that correctly calls the superclass's `__init__` method, which is a key concept in object-oriented programming in Python.\n\nOverall, the distractors are effective in testing the student's understanding of how to correctly call a superclass's method in Python."
