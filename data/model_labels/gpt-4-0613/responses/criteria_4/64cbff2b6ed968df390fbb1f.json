The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

They cover a range of possible misconceptions a student might have about the code snippet. \n\nThe first distractor \"`| Spring | Summer | Fall | ? |`\" could trick students who don't understand that tuples can be converted to lists, modified, and then converted back to tuples.\n\nThe second distractor \"`| Spring | Summer | Fall |`\" might appeal to students who think that the fourth element of the tuple cannot be changed at all.\n\nThe third distractor \"`| Spring |`\" could mislead students who don't understand how the for loop works in this context.\n\nThe fourth distractor \"Nothing. This program would raise an error.\" could trick students who believe that tuples are immutable and cannot be changed in any way, even by converting to a list and back.\n\nTherefore, none of the incorrect answers can be easily eliminated without a good understanding of Python programming, making them effective distractors."
