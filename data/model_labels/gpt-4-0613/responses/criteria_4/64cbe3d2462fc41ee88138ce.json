The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "The distractors in this multiple-choice question are well constructed. They are all Python libraries, which makes them homogeneous and parallel in format. They are also of similar length and structure, which is another requirement for good distractors.\n\nThe first distractor, NumPy, is a library that is often used in data science, which is the context of the question. However, as the explanation states, it doesn't support web scraping or Excel file operations, which are the specific tasks the question is about. This makes it a plausible but incorrect answer.\n\nThe second distractor, matplotlib, is also a library that is often used in data science. However, it is a plotting library and doesn't provide capabilities for web scraping or Excel file manipulation. This makes it another plausible but incorrect answer.\n\nBoth distractors are incorrect, but they are not easily eliminated without knowledge of what each library is used for. This makes them effective distractors."
