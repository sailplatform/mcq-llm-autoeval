The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "The distractors in this multiple-choice question are good and cannot be easily eliminated without a solid understanding of numpy array operations in Python. \n\nThe first distractor is a common way to perform element-wise multiplication in Python without using numpy's vectorization feature. This could be a plausible answer for someone who is not familiar with numpy's capabilities.\n\nThe second distractor, `np.multiply(a, b)`, is also a valid way to perform element-wise multiplication in numpy. However, it is not the most efficient way to take full advantage of array vectorization in numpy, which is what the question is asking for. This distractor is good because it is technically correct, but not the best answer to the question, making it a challenging option to eliminate.\n\nThe correct answer, `res = a * b`, is the most efficient way to perform element-wise multiplication in numpy, taking full advantage of array vectorization.\n\nOverall, this question is well-structured and the distractors are effective in testing the student's understanding of numpy array operations."
