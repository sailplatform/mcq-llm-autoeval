The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "The distractors in this multiple-choice question are quite good. Both distractors are plausible answers for someone who is not familiar with Python's use in data science. \n\nThe first distractor, \"low-level feature set\", could be misleading for students who might think that Python's popularity in data science is due to its low-level capabilities, which is not the case. Python is actually a high-level language, but this distractor could confuse students who are not clear on the difference between high-level and low-level programming languages.\n\nThe second distractor, \"web development capabilities\", is also a good distractor. Python is indeed used in web development, but this is not the primary reason for its popularity in data science. This distractor could mislead students who know about Python's use in web development but are not familiar with its use in data science.\n\nOverall, both distractors are plausible and not easily eliminated, making this a well-constructed multiple-choice question."
