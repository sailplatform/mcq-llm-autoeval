The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "The distractors in this multiple-choice question are well-crafted and relevant to the question. They all discuss the concept of polymorphism and suggest different methods that could be used to fill in the missing line of code. This requires the student to have a good understanding of Python and polymorphism to correctly identify the correct answer.\n\nHowever, the distractors that suggest the `len` function could be redefined can be easily eliminated by a student with a good understanding of Python. The `len` function is not being used in a way that would suggest it is being redefined in the code snippet. Therefore, these distractors may not be as effective as they could be.\n\nOverall, the distractors are good but could be improved by making them less easily eliminated. For example, all distractors could suggest different methods that could be used to redefine the addition operator, requiring the student to understand the specific implementation in the code snippet to identify the correct answer."
