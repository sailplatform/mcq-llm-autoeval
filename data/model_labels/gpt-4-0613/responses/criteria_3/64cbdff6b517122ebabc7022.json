The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem and adheres to the following properties.\n1. A distractor should not be obviously wrong. In other words, it must still bear relations to the stem and correct answer. \n2. A distractor should be phrased positively and be a true statement that does not correctly answer the stem, all while giving no clues towards the correct answer.\n3. Although a distractor is incorrect, it must be plausible: in other words, it must be positioned such that a student who does not fully grasp the topic may believe that the distractor is the correct answer choice. \n4. A distractor must be incorrect. It cannot be correct, or interpreted as correct by someone who strongly grasps the topic.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\n\n"

To analyze the data, he decides to take advantage of pandas Series, which can build on top of numpy datatypes. He needs to create a Series object that represents the quantity of apples sold each day over a given week, where the quantity sold might be in floating point numbers as there could be transactions with partial amounts.\\\\n\\\\nGiven that the record of sales is as follows: Monday - 35.5, Tuesday - 40, Wednesday - 30, Thursday - 50.2, Friday - 42, Saturday - 60.1, Sunday - 52.5. Which of the following code snippets does this accurately using pandas Series?\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"import pandas as pd\\\\n\\\\napples_sold = pd.Series({'Monday': 35.5, 'Tuesday': 40, 'Wednesday': 30, 'Thursday': 50.2, 'Friday': 42, 'Saturday': 60.1, 'Sunday': 52.5}, dtype='float')\",\n            \"correct\": \"true\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"import pandas as pd\\\\n\\\\napples_sold = pd.Series([35.5, 40, 30, 50.2, 42, 60.1, 52.5])\",\n            \"correct\": \"false\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"import pandas as pd\\\\n\\\\napples_sold = pd.Series({'Monday': '35.5', 'Tuesday': '40', 'Wednesday': '30', 'Thursday': '50.2', 'Friday': '42', 'Saturday': '60.1', 'Sunday': '52.5'})\",\n            \"correct\": \"false\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nAre the distractors that are completely unique, or are they similar?"

        "content": "The distractors in this multiple-choice question are similar in the sense that they all involve creating a pandas Series object in Python. However, they are unique in the way they attempt to create the Series. The first distractor uses a list of numbers without specifying the days of the week, which is incorrect because the question specifies that the Series should represent the quantity of apples sold each day. The second distractor uses a dictionary to create the Series, but the quantities are represented as strings instead of floating point numbers, which is also incorrect. Therefore, while the distractors are similar in their overall approach, they are unique in their specific implementations."
