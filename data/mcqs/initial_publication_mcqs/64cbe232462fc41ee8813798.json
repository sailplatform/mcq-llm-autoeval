    "question": "Fill in the blank: Consider the following Python script. The script attempts to add elements to a list and a set and then prints them. However, there is a piece of code missing. What Python code should replace the blank such that the following behavior is observed?\\n```python\\nmy_list = []\\nmy_set = set()\\nfor i in range(5):\\n    ____\\nprint(my_list)\\nprint(my_set)\\n```The order of the elements in 'my_list' is preserved, i.e., the printed list is '0, 1, 2, 3, 4'. However, the printed set 'my_set' does not preserve the order of elements.",
