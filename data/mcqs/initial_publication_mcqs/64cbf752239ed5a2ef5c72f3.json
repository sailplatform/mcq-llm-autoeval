    "question": "Liam is designing a simple game in Python where a user needs to guess a randomly generated number. He wants to implement a system to give feedback after each guess - letting the user know if their guess was too high, too low or correct. Which Python data type would Liam need to use for this kind of operation to determine whether the user's guess is higher, lower or equal to the randomly generated number?",
