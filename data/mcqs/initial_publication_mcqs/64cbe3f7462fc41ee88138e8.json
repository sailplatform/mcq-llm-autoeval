    "question": "You are helping out in a summer data analytics program. A high school student asks you this question: 'I have collected data for the last six months on different species of insects found in a particular area. For each month, I have the number of total specie identified, total insect population and the most dominating specie. I want to make a line graph for the six months, but all three values in one line graph is confusing. How should I adjust the graph?'",

        },
        {
            "choice": "Use a line graph only for the number of total species identified each month, a separate bar chart for total insect population every month, and a pie chart representing the most dominating specie each month.",
