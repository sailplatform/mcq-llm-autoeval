    "question": "Consider the following programming scenario:\\nYour task is to implement a Python function named `store_data` that takes as input a list of tuples. Each tuple contains a username (a string) and a set of grades (a set of integers). The function should store data in such a way that would allow for efficient search and update operations. What type of Data Structure would be appropriate for implementing this?",
