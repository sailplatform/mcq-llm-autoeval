The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "From the perspective of a student familiar with Python programming, I would evaluate the distractors in this multiple-choice question as follows:\n\nDistractor 1: \"low-level feature set\"\nThis distractor is effective. While Python does provide some low-level capabilities, it is not the primary reason for its popularity in data science. A student with a basic understanding of Python might be tempted to select this option, thinking Python's versatility is due to low-level features.\n\nDistractor 2: \"web development capabilities\" \nThis distractor is also effective. Python is indeed used for web development, with frameworks like Django and Flask. However, web development is not the main reason for Python's extensive use in data science. A student who has used Python for web development or has heard of its web frameworks might be drawn to this option.\n\nThe correct answer, \"simplicity and powerful libraries for data analysis and manipulation,\" clearly stands out as the best choice for someone with a good understanding of Python's strengths in data science.\n\nIn summary, both distractors are plausible choices that might appeal to students with an incomplete understanding of Python's role in data science. They cannot be easily eliminated, making them effective distractors. The question overall is well-constructed, as it requires a student to have a clear grasp of Python's key features and its applications in data science to select the correct answer confidently."

This principle can be evaluated as one of the following three options, label the evaluations as options 1 through 3.\n1: There are no obviously wrong options that give away the answer easily\n2: There is at least one option that can be easily eliminated as being incorrect\n\nWhen asked to evaluate a question, return the evaluation key.
