The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "From the perspective of a student familiar with Python programming, I would evaluate the distractors in this multiple-choice question as follows:\n\nDistractor 1: \"Change Line 1 to: `side = float(1.2)`\"\nThis distractor is plausible. While it's not necessary to explicitly convert 1.2 to a float since Python will handle the type automatically, a student might think this is required. It's not easily eliminated.\n\nDistractor 2: \"Change Line 1 to: `float(side) = 1.2`\"\nThis distractor is not as strong. Assigning a value to a function call like `float(side)` is not valid Python syntax. A student with a solid grasp of Python basics would likely eliminate this choice quickly.\n\nDistractor 3: \"Change Line 1 to: `side_length = 1.2` and Line 2 to: `area = side_length * side_length`\"\nThis distractor is quite plausible. The code would work correctly, but it makes an unnecessary variable name change. A student might think this is the best answer if they're unsure about changing as little code as possible.\n\nOverall, Distractors 1 and 3 are fairly strong, as they're not easily eliminated and could seem correct to a student who is second-guessing themselves. However, Distractor 2 is weaker since it uses invalid Python syntax that a student with a good understanding would spot.\n\nTo improve this multiple-choice question, I would suggest replacing Distractor 2 with a more plausible option that can't be easily ruled out, in order to better assess the student's understanding of the concepts being tested."
