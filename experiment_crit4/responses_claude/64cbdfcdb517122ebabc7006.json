The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "Let me evaluate this multiple-choice question from the perspective of a student familiar with Python programming.\n\nThe question stem provides a code snippet using the NumPy library to multiply two arrays element-wise. To answer this question, I need to understand how NumPy handles array multiplication.\n\nLooking at the answer choices:\n\n1. [6, 14, 24, 36, 50] - This looks like the correct answer. Multiplying the elements of v1 and v2 element-wise should produce these values.\n\n2. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] - This is just a concatenation of the two input arrays. It's not the result of any multiplication operation, so I can eliminate this option.\n\n3. Error, vectorization is not supported in Python. - This is not true. Python does support vectorization through libraries like NumPy. So I can confidently eliminate this distractor as well.\n\nEvaluating the distractors:\nThe second distractor can be easily eliminated by a student who understands basic array operations. Concatenating the input arrays is not a plausible outcome for multiplication.\n\nThe third distractor can also be eliminated by anyone familiar with Python and NumPy. Stating that vectorization is not supported in Python is factually incorrect.\n\nIn summary, the distractors in this multiple-choice question are not effective. They can be easily eliminated by a student with basic knowledge of Python and NumPy, leaving the correct answer as the only viable choice. To improve this question, the distractors should be replaced with plausible incorrect answers that demonstrate potential misconceptions or common errors when multiplying NumPy arrays."

This principle can be evaluated as one of the following three options, label the evaluations as options 1 through 3.\n1: There are no obviously wrong options that give away the answer easily\n2: There is at least one option that can be easily eliminated as being incorrect\n\nWhen asked to evaluate a question, return the evaluation key.
