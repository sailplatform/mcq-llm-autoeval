The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "Let me first try to answer this question as a student familiar with Python programming.\n\nThe question provides a function `greeting` that takes a parameter `name` and returns a string \"Hello, \" concatenated with the `name` parameter. In the `print` statement, the function is called with the argument `1234`, which is an integer.\n\nIn Python, concatenating a string with an integer will raise a `TypeError`, because you can only concatenate strings with other strings. Therefore, the correct answer is \"TypeError: can only concatenate str (not \"int\") to str\".\n\nNow, evaluating the distractors:\n\n1. \"Hello, 1234\" - This distractor is plausible if the student thinks that Python will automatically convert the integer to a string during concatenation. However, Python does not do this implicit conversion, making this a good distractor.\n\n2. \"1234\" - This distractor is less plausible because it suggests that the function would simply return the input argument without any modification or concatenation. A student with a basic understanding of Python functions and string concatenation would likely eliminate this option.\n\nOverall, the first distractor is strong because it represents a common misconception about Python's handling of data types during concatenation. The second distractor, while not as strong, still requires the student to understand the function's behavior and the expected output.\n\nIn summary, the distractors are of good quality, with one being particularly effective and the other being satisfactory. The question tests the student's understanding of Python data types, string concatenation, and function behavior."

This principle can be evaluated as one of the following three options, label the evaluations as options 1 through 3.\n1: There are no obviously wrong options that give away the answer easily\n2: There is at least one option that can be easily eliminated as being incorrect\n\nWhen asked to evaluate a question, return the evaluation key.
