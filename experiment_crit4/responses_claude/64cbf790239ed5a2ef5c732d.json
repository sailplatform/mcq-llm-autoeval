The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "Let me try to answer this question as if I were a student familiar with Python programming and the bubble sort algorithm.\n\nThe correct answer is: \"Bubble-sort algorithm does comparisons and swaps until the list is sorted.\"\n\nEvaluating the distractors:\n\n1. \"Bubble-sort algorithm sorts the list by swapping elements in pairs from beginning to end of list in one pass.\"\n   This distractor is plausible because the bubble sort algorithm does involve swapping adjacent elements. However, it is incorrect because the bubble sort algorithm requires multiple passes through the list, not just one pass, to fully sort the list.\n\n2. \"Bubble-sort algorithm sorts the list in one complete single pass without multiple iterations.\"\n   This distractor is less plausible because it contradicts the fundamental nature of the bubble sort algorithm, which requires multiple iterations to sort the list. A student with a basic understanding of the bubble sort algorithm should be able to eliminate this option.\n\nEvaluation:\nThe first distractor is a good one because it incorporates a partially correct understanding of the bubble sort algorithm (swapping adjacent elements) but introduces an error (sorting in a single pass). This distractor could potentially trick students who have an incomplete understanding of the algorithm.\n\nThe second distractor, however, is weaker because it can be more easily eliminated by students with a basic grasp of the bubble sort algorithm. It contradicts the core principle of the algorithm requiring multiple iterations.\n\nTo improve the question, I would suggest replacing the second distractor with a more plausible option that could challenge students with a partial understanding of the bubble sort algorithm. For example:\n\n\"Bubble-sort algorithm compares each element with every other element in the list to determine the correct order.\"\n\nThis distractor introduces a common misconception about the bubble sort algorithm, which only compares adjacent elements, not every element with every other element."

This principle can be evaluated as one of the following three options, label the evaluations as options 1 through 3.\n1: There are no obviously wrong options that give away the answer easily\n2: There is at least one option that can be easily eliminated as being incorrect\n\nWhen asked to evaluate a question, return the evaluation key.
