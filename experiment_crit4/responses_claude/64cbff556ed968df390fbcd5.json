The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "Here is my evaluation of the distractors in this multiple-choice question:\n\nThe correct answer is: \"like ASCII, but much more expansive\"\n\nDistractor 1: \"used by coders from universities\"\nThis distractor is somewhat plausible, as it associates Unicode with coding/computers which is on the right track. However, it focuses on a specific group using it rather than what Unicode actually is. A student with basic knowledge of Unicode could likely eliminate this.\n\nDistractor 2: \"honored by the whole universe\" \nThis distractor plays on the \"uni\" prefix but is quite nonsensical and easy to eliminate. Unicode has nothing to do with being \"honored\" or \"the whole universe\". Most students could confidently rule this out.\n\nDistractor 3: \"for coding floating-point numbers\"\nThis distractor is the most plausible, as it positions Unicode as a coding standard which is correct. However, it incorrectly specifies it as being for floating-point numbers. A student would need to know that Unicode is actually a character encoding standard to eliminate this choice.\n\nIn summary, Distractor 1 and especially Distractor 2 are quite weak, as they can be eliminated by students with even basic familiarity with Unicode. Distractor 3 is the strongest, as it requires more specific knowledge to identify as incorrect.\n\nTo improve this question, I would suggest replacing Distractors 1 and 2 with choices that are more plausible and require a deeper understanding to rule out, such as:\n\n\"a 16-bit character encoding standard\" (Unicode is a character encoding standard but uses more than 16 bits)\n\n\"a standard for encoding webpages and HTML\" (confuses it with other web standards)\n\nThis would make the incorrect answers harder to eliminate and require the student to have a firmer grasp of exactly what Unicode is in order to arrive at the correct answer. Let me know if you would like me to suggest any other improvements!"
