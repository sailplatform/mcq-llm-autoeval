The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "Let me first try to answer the question as a student familiar with Python programming:\n\nTo access files in different directories, the os module would be very helpful as it provides functions for interacting with the operating system, including file and directory operations. The csv module is also needed to read from and write to CSV files.\n\nThe math module provides mathematical functions, and the time module helps with time-related tasks, but neither of them are directly relevant for accessing files and directories.\n\nSo the correct answer is \"os, csv\".\n\nNow, evaluating the distractors from a student's perspective:\n\n1. \"math, csv\" - The math module is not relevant for the given task, but the csv module is needed. A student who is not fully clear about the purpose of the math module might consider this option.\n\n2. \"time, csv\" - Similar to the previous option, the time module is not directly helpful for the given task, but the csv module is required. A student might get confused and think that time tracking could be involved in the project.\n\nThe distractors are somewhat plausible if a student is not entirely clear about the functionalities of the math and time modules, and how they differ from os in terms of file and directory handling. However, a student with a good understanding of these modules would easily eliminate both distractors.\n\nTo improve the question, the distractors could be made more challenging by including options that are more closely related to file and directory handling, such as:\n\n- \"shutil, csv\" (shutil is used for high-level file and directory operations)\n- \"glob, csv\" (glob is used for generating file paths matching a pattern)\n\nThese distractors would require a deeper understanding of Python modules related to file handling, making the question more challenging."
