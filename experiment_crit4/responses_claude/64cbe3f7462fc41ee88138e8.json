The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

A high school student asks you this question: 'I have collected data for the last six months on different species of insects found in a particular area. For each month, I have the number of total specie identified, total insect population and the most dominating specie. I want to make a line graph for the six months, but all three values in one line graph is confusing. How should I adjust the graph?'\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"Plot all data points in one line graph without any differentiation.\",\n            \"correct\": \"false\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"Use a line graph only for the number of total species identified each month, a separate bar chart for total insect population every month, and a pie chart representing the most dominating specie each month.\",\n            \"correct\": \"true\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"Use only one type of graph (line, pie or bar) for all three data points.\",\n            \"correct\": \"false\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nFrom the perspective of a student answering this Multiple-choice question, how good are the distractors?

        "content": "From the perspective of a student familiar with data visualization techniques, I would evaluate the distractors in this multiple-choice question as follows:\n\nDistractor 1: \"Plot all data points in one line graph without any differentiation.\"\nThis distractor is somewhat effective. A student with limited knowledge might think that putting all the data in one graph is a viable solution. However, a more knowledgeable student would recognize that this would lead to a confusing and hard-to-interpret graph, as mentioned in the question stem.\n\nDistractor 2: \"Use only one type of graph (line, pie or bar) for all three data points.\"\nThis distractor is less effective. Most students with a basic understanding of data visualization would know that different types of data are best represented by different types of graphs. Using the same graph type for all three diverse data points would not effectively communicate the insights from the data.\n\nThe correct answer, \"Use a line graph only for the number of total species identified each month, a separate bar chart for total insect population every month, and a pie chart representing the most dominating specie each month,\" demonstrates an understanding of matching appropriate graph types to different data types.\n\nTo improve the distractors, I would suggest:\n1. Making distractor 2 more plausible by suggesting a combination of graph types that might seem reasonable but wouldn't effectively convey the data, such as \"Use a line graph for total species and total population, and a bar chart for the most dominating species.\"\n\n2. Adding more specificity to distractor 1, such as \"Plot total species, total population, and most dominant species as three separate lines on the same line graph,\" to make it a more tempting choice for students who recognize that multiple lines can be graphed together.\n\nIn summary, while the distractors are not entirely ineffective, they could be improved to be more challenging for students with a solid grasp of data visualization principles."
