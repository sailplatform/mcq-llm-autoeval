The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "Let me try answering this question as a student familiar with Python programming.\n\nThe code implements the bubble sort algorithm. It uses nested loops to compare adjacent elements and swap them if they are in the wrong order. The outer loop runs for the length of the list, and the inner loop compares each pair of adjacent elements, swapping them if needed. This process is repeated until the list is sorted.\n\nLooking at the answer choices:\n\n1. \"It sorts the list in descending order.\" - This is incorrect. The code compares elements and swaps them if list[j] > list[j + 1], which means it sorts the list in ascending order.\n\n2. \"It sorts the list in ascending order.\" - This is the correct answer. The bubble sort algorithm implemented in the code sorts the list in ascending order by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.\n\n3. \"It reverses the list.\" - This is incorrect. The code does not simply reverse the order of elements in the list. It performs a sorting operation based on comparing adjacent elements.\n\nEvaluating the distractors:\n\nDistractor 1 (\"It sorts the list in descending order\") is a good distractor. It is related to sorting but mentions the opposite order (descending) compared to the correct answer (ascending). A student who doesn't fully understand the bubble sort algorithm might be tempted to choose this option.\n\nDistractor 3 (\"It reverses the list\") is a weaker distractor. While it is incorrect, it is not closely related to the concept of sorting. A student with a basic understanding of sorting algorithms would likely eliminate this option easily.\n\nTo improve the question, I would suggest replacing distractor 3 with a more plausible option related to sorting algorithms or the specific implementation. For example:\n\n- \"It sorts the list using the selection sort algorithm.\"\n- \"It sorts the list by comparing each element with the first element of the list.\"\n\nThese distractors would require a deeper understanding of different sorting algorithms and their implementations, making them more challenging to eliminate for students who are not fully familiar with the bubble sort algorithm.\n\nOverall, the question has one good distractor and one weaker distractor. Replacing the weaker distractor with a more relevant and plausible option would enhance the effectiveness of the question in assessing students' understanding of the bubble sort algorithm."
