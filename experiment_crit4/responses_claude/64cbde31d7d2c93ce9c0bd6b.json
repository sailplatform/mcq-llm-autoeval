The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "Let me evaluate this question from the perspective of a student familiar with Python programming.\n\nThe correct answer is clearly \"For loop\", since a for loop is used when you want to execute a block of code a predetermined number of times.\n\nLooking at the distractors:\n\n\"While loop\" is a plausible distractor. While loops are used when you want to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is true. The number of iterations is not necessarily known in advance. So a student who doesn't have a clear understanding of the difference might select this.\n\n\"Until loop\" is not a valid Python construct. There is no such thing as an \"until loop\" in Python. So this is not a strong distractor, as any student with basic Python knowledge can easily eliminate this choice.\n\nIn summary, while the \"While loop\" distractor is reasonable, the \"Until loop\" distractor is quite weak, as it can be easily eliminated by anyone with foundational Python knowledge. \n\nTo improve this question, I would suggest replacing \"Until loop\" with a more plausible distractor, perhaps something like \"Recursive function call\", which, while not a loop, could be used to execute code multiple times and might confuse students who are less clear on the distinctions.\n\nThe question stem itself is clear and tests a specific, important concept in Python programming. With a stronger second distractor, this could be a good, discriminating question."

This principle can be evaluated as one of the following three options, label the evaluations as options 1 through 3.\n1: There are no obviously wrong options that give away the answer easily\n2: There is at least one option that can be easily eliminated as being incorrect\n\nWhen asked to evaluate a question, return the evaluation key.
