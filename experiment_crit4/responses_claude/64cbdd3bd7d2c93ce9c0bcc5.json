The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

There must be no incorrect answers that can easily be eliminated.\n"

        "content": "From the perspective of a student familiar with Python programming, I would evaluate the distractors in this multiple-choice question as follows:\n\nDistractor 1: \"It means that 5 is equal to x.\"\nThis distractor could be eliminated by a student who understands that in Python, the '=' sign is used for assignment, not equality comparison. The statement \"x = 5\" assigns the value 5 to the variable x, rather than checking if 5 is equal to x. A student with a basic understanding of Python syntax would likely rule out this option.\n\nDistractor 2: \"It means that the variable x is assigning the value 5.\"\nThis distractor is more plausible than the first one. It correctly identifies that the '=' sign is used for assignment. However, it states that the variable x is assigning the value 5, which is not entirely accurate. In reality, the value 5 is being assigned to the variable x. While this distractor is closer to the correct answer, a student with a solid grasp of Python assignment statements might still be able to eliminate it.\n\nOverall, the distractors in this question are of moderate quality. Distractor 1 can be easily eliminated by students with a basic understanding of Python syntax, while Distractor 2 is more plausible but still not entirely accurate. To improve the question, Distractor 1 could be replaced with a more challenging option that is harder to eliminate, and Distractor 2 could be rephrased to be more clearly incorrect."

This principle can be evaluated as one of the following three options, label the evaluations as options 1 through 3.\n1: There are no obviously wrong options that give away the answer easily\n2: There is at least one option that can be easily eliminated as being incorrect\n\nWhen asked to evaluate a question, return the evaluation key.
