The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "Let me first try to answer the question as a student familiar with Python:\n\nThe ord() function returns the Unicode code point of a character, and the chr() function returns the character for a given Unicode code point. 'z' has the Unicode code point of 122. Subtracting 2 from that gives 120, which is the Unicode code point for 'x'. So the code will print 'x'.\n\nEvaluating the distractors:\n\n1. `y`: This is the character just before 'z', so it's a plausible distractor for students who understand ord() and chr() but miscalculate the arithmetic.\n\n2. `z`: This is the original character, so it could catch students who skip over the subtraction.\n\n3. `a`: This distractor is less effective. 'a' is very far away from 'z' in the Unicode table, so it's unlikely to result from a minor mistake in understanding the code.\n\nOverall, two of the three distractors are quite good. They represent answers that could result from small errors in reasoning about the code. The third distractor `a` is less plausible and easier to eliminate.\n\nTo improve this, I would replace the distractor `a` with a choice closer to the correct answer, such as `w`, which could result if the student subtracted 1 instead of 2.\n\nBut in general, this is a well-constructed multiple choice question. The code snippet is concise, the distractors are mostly plausible, and answering it correctly requires understanding how ord(), chr() and arithmetic work together in Python."
