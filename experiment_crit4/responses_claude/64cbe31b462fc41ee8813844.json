The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "From the perspective of a student familiar with Python programming, I would evaluate the distractors in this multiple-choice question as follows:\n\nThe first distractor, \"matplotlib\", is a reasonable distractor. Matplotlib is a widely used Python library for data visualization and plotting. A student who is not fully familiar with the specific use cases of different Python libraries might consider this as a potential answer.\n\nThe second distractor, \"math\", is a weaker distractor. While the math module in Python provides various mathematical functions, it does not have a built-in function for calculating the median of a list efficiently. A student with a good understanding of Python's standard libraries would likely eliminate this option quickly.\n\nThe correct answer, \"numpy\", is the most suitable choice. NumPy is a fundamental library for scientific computing in Python, providing support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently. It includes functions like np.median() that can calculate the median of a list or array much faster than a custom implementation.\n\nTo improve the distractors, I would suggest replacing the \"math\" distractor with another commonly used Python library that might seem plausible for optimizing code, such as \"pandas\" or \"scipy\". This would make the distractors more challenging and less easily eliminated.\n\nOverall, while the distractors are not entirely ineffective, there is room for improvement to make them more robust and challenging for students with a solid understanding of Python programming."
