The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "From the perspective of a student familiar with Python programming, I would evaluate the distractors in this multiple-choice question as follows:\n\nDistractor 1: \"Function 1: Calculates the average temperature and returns the value. Function 2: Prints the calculated average temperature.\"\nThis distractor is reasonably good. Both functions described are valid and common approaches in Python - one returns a value while the other prints output as a side effect. A student would need to carefully consider the distinction between returning values and causing side effects to eliminate this choice.\n\nDistractor 2: \"Function 1: Calculates and prints the average temperature as well as some descriptive statistics of the temperature data. Function 2: Calculates the average temperature and returns the value.\"\nThis distractor is also fairly effective. Again, both functions are plausible. Function 1 has the side effect of printing output, while function 2 returns a value. Eliminating this requires an understanding of the specific terminology around \"side effects\" vs \"returning values\".\n\nThe correct answer is clearly distinguished from the distractors, as it's the only choice that accurately categorizes the functions based on returning values vs side effects.\n\nOverall, I believe the distractors in this question are effective. They present plausible alternative function designs that require careful analysis to eliminate. The distractors are not obviously incorrect to a student with knowledge of Python functions, return values, and side effects. To answer correctly, the student must have a clear grasp of these concepts.\n\nIn summary, from the perspective of a student, I don't see any issues with the distractors that would allow them to be too easily eliminated compared to the correct answer. The question should effectively assess the intended understanding."
