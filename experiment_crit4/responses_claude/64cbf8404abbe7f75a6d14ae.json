The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "Let me first try to answer the question as a student familiar with Python programming.\n\nThe function extract_element() takes a list my_list and an index i as arguments. It attempts to return the element at index i in my_list. If i is out of range, it catches the IndexError exception and returns 'The list is too short!'. If i is not an integer, it catches the TypeError exception and returns 'An integer is required!'.\n\nWhen calling extract_element([1,2,3],'two'), 'two' is a string, not an integer. This will raise a TypeError exception, which will be caught, and the function will return 'An integer is required!'.\n\nSo the correct answer is: \"The function will return 'An integer is required!'.\"\n\nNow let's evaluate the distractors:\n\n1. \"The function will return 'The list is too short!'.\": This is incorrect. The IndexError exception is raised when the index is out of range, not when the index is of the wrong type. A student who understands exception handling in Python should be able to eliminate this distractor.\n\n2. \"The function will raise an 'IndexError' exception.\": This is incorrect. The function catches the IndexError exception and returns a string instead of raising the exception. A student who understands the purpose of the try-except block should be able to eliminate this distractor.\n\nIn conclusion, the distractors in this question are effective. They represent common misconceptions or errors that a student might make when dealing with exception handling and indexing in Python. The incorrect answers cannot be easily eliminated by a student who understands the concepts being tested.\n\nThe question stem provides clear context and the necessary code to answer the question. The answer choices are parallel in structure and length.\n\nOverall, this is a well-constructed multiple-choice question that effectively assesses a student's understanding of exception handling and indexing in Python."
