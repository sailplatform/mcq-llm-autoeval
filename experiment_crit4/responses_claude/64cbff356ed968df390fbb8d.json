The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

There must be no incorrect answers that can easily be eliminated.\n"

        "content": "From the perspective of a student familiar with Python programming, I would evaluate the distractors in this multiple-choice question as follows:\n\nDistractor 1: \"Machine code executed by computers\"\nThis distractor is plausible for a student who may confuse source code with the low-level machine code that computers directly execute. However, a student with a solid understanding of programming concepts would likely be able to eliminate this option, as they would know that source code is written in high-level languages, not machine code.\n\nDistractor 2: \"Another name for a source file\"\nThis distractor is weaker compared to the first one. While source files do contain source code, the terms \"source code\" and \"source file\" are not interchangeable. A student with a basic understanding of programming terminology would likely be able to eliminate this distractor.\n\nOverall, the distractors in this multiple-choice question are of mixed quality. Distractor 1 is reasonably effective, as it may trap students who have misconceptions about the relationship between source code and machine code. However, Distractor 2 is less effective, as it can be easily eliminated by students with a basic grasp of programming terms.\n\nTo improve the question, I would suggest replacing Distractor 2 with a more plausible option that aligns with common misconceptions or closely relates to the concept of source code. This would make the distractors more challenging and effective in assessing the student's understanding of the topic."

This principle can be evaluated as one of the following three options, label the evaluations as options 1 through 3.\n1: There are no obviously wrong options that give away the answer easily\n2: There is at least one option that can be easily eliminated as being incorrect\n\nWhen asked to evaluate a question, return the evaluation key.
