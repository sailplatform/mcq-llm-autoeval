The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "From the perspective of a student familiar with Python programming, I would evaluate the distractors in this multiple-choice question as follows:\n\nThe correct answer, \"access a super class's attributes and/or methods\", accurately describes the purpose of the super() function in Python.\n\nDistractor 1: \"make a class super\"\nThis distractor is somewhat weak. While it plays on the name \"super\", it doesn't really make sense in the context of Python classes and inheritance. A student with a basic understanding of Python would likely be able to eliminate this as a possibility fairly easily.\n\nDistractor 2: \"make a class better\" \nThis distractor is also quite weak. It is vague and doesn't relate directly to the functionality of super() or to Python classes and inheritance. Like the first distractor, most students with Python knowledge would be able to confidently rule this out.\n\nIn summary, while the correct answer is clear and unambiguous, the two distractors are not particularly effective. They can be eliminated without much thought by anyone with a basic grasp of Python, rather than requiring a deeper understanding of the super() function specifically.\n\nTo improve this question, the distractors should be replaced with options that are more plausible and more closely related to the topic of class inheritance in Python. This would better test the student's knowledge of when and how to use super()."

This principle can be evaluated as one of the following three options, label the evaluations as options 1 through 3.\n1: There are no obviously wrong options that give away the answer easily\n2: There is at least one option that can be easily eliminated as being incorrect\n\nWhen asked to evaluate a question, return the evaluation key.
