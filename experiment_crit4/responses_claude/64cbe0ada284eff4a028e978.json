The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "From the perspective of a student familiar with Python programming, I would evaluate the distractors in this multiple-choice question as follows:\n\nDistractor 1: \n```python\nfactorial_gen = [reduce(lambda x, y: x*y, range(1, num+1)) for num in list]\n```\nThis distractor uses a list comprehension instead of a generator expression. While it calculates the factorials correctly using `reduce()` and `lambda`, it creates a list, which doesn't take advantage of the memory efficiency of generators. A student who understands the difference between list comprehensions and generator expressions might be able to eliminate this distractor.\n\nDistractor 2:\n```python\nfactorial_gen = [factorial(num) for num in list]\n```\nThis distractor assumes the existence of a `factorial()` function, which is not provided in the question. A student who is not aware of a built-in `factorial()` function in Python might consider this distractor plausible. However, a student with a solid understanding of Python's standard library could eliminate this distractor.\n\nThe correct answer uses a generator expression with `reduce()` and `lambda` to calculate the factorials, which is memory-efficient and leverages the benefits of generators.\n\nOverall, the distractors are reasonably good, as they test the student's understanding of the differences between list comprehensions, generator expressions, and built-in functions. However, Distractor 2 might be easier to eliminate for students with a strong grasp of Python's standard library. Distractor 1 is a stronger distractor, as it more closely resembles the correct answer and tests the student's understanding of the specific benefits of generator expressions over list comprehensions."
