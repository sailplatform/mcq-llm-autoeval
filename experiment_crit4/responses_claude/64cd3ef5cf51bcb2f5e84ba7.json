The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "From the perspective of a student familiar with Python programming and the Seaborn library, I would evaluate the distractors as follows:\n\nDistractor 1:\n```python\nimport seaborn as sns\nsns.pointplot(x='Season', y='Temperature', hue='Rain_Fall', data=df)\n```\nThis distractor is quite plausible. The `pointplot` function in Seaborn is used to plot the mean and confidence interval of a categorical variable against a numeric variable. It could be a reasonable choice for visualizing the variations of 'Temperature' and 'Rain_Fall' across different 'Seasons'. However, it may not be the best choice for showing the overall trend and relationship between the variables.\n\nDistractor 2:\n```python\nimport seaborn as sns\nsns.barplot(x='Temperature', y='Rain_Fall', hue='Season', data=df)\n```\nThis distractor is also plausible. The `barplot` function in Seaborn is used to show the relationship between a categorical variable and a numeric variable using rectangular bars. However, in this case, the x and y variables are both numeric ('Temperature' and 'Rain_Fall'), which makes it less suitable for a bar plot. Additionally, the 'Season' variable is used as the `hue` parameter, which would create separate bars for each season, making it harder to visualize the variations across seasons.\n\nOverall, both distractors are plausible and cannot be easily eliminated by a student who understands the Seaborn library and the purpose of different plot types. They serve as good distractors because they use relevant Seaborn functions and parameters, but they may not be the most appropriate choices for the given scenario.\n\nThe correct answer, using `sns.lineplot()`, is indeed the best choice for visualizing the variations of 'Temperature' and 'Rain_Fall' throughout different 'Seasons', as it shows the trend and relationship between the variables effectively."
