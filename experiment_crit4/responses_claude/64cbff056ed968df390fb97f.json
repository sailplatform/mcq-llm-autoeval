The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "From the perspective of a student familiar with Python programming, I would evaluate the distractors in this multiple-choice question as follows:\n\nDistractor 1: `pd.read_csv(\"tickets_monthly.csv\", index=0)` \nThis distractor uses `index=0` instead of `index_col=0`. It's a plausible mistake for a student to make, confusing the row index with the index column. It can't be easily eliminated.\n\nDistractor 2: `pd.read_csv(\"tickets_monthly\", index_col=0)`\nThis distractor is missing the \".csv\" file extension. Again, it's a mistake a student could conceivably make, so it serves as a reasonable distractor that can't be immediately ruled out.\n\nDistractor 3: `pd.read_csv(\"tickets_monthly.csv\", index_col=0)`\nThis distractor is actually identical to the correct answer, just without assigning the result to a variable. As a student, I would have to think carefully to eliminate this one, since the only difference is it doesn't save the DataFrame to a variable name.\n\nDistractor 4: `df = pd.read_csv(\"tickets_monthly.csv\", index='month')`\nThis distractor uses `index='month'` instead of `index_col=0`. It's testing whether the student knows to use the column index 0 vs the column name 'month'. It's a nuanced difference that requires careful reading to identify.\n\nOverall, I think these are good, challenging distractors for this question. None of them have obvious errors that would allow a student to eliminate them right away without careful consideration. They all test subtle differences in syntax or parameter names that could trip up a student who doesn't have a firm grasp of the `read_csv` function. As a student, I would have to think critically about each option to identify the correct answer."
