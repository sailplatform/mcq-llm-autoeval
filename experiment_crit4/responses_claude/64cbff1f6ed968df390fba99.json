The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "From the perspective of a student familiar with Python programming, I would evaluate this multiple-choice question as follows:\n\nThe question stem is clear and concise. It asks the student to evaluate a specific Python expression and determine if the result is True or False.\n\nAttempting to answer the question:\nThe expression \"5\" == 5 compares a string \"5\" with the integer 5. In Python, the == operator checks for equality, but it does not perform type coercion. Therefore, comparing a string with an integer using == will always return False.\n\nEvaluating the answer choices:\n- Choice 1: \"False\" - This is the correct answer, as explained above.\n- Choice 2: \"True\" - This is a distractor, but it is a plausible one. A student who is not clear about the behavior of the == operator when comparing different types might think that the string \"5\" and the integer 5 are equal.\n\nEvaluating the distractors:\nThe distractor \"True\" is effective because it represents a common misconception about the == operator. Students who are not well-versed in Python's type comparison rules might fall for this distractor.\n\nHowever, there is only one distractor provided in this question. A well-constructed multiple-choice question should have two distractors and one correct answer. With only one distractor, the student has a 50% chance of guessing the correct answer if they can eliminate the single distractor.\n\nTo improve this question, I would recommend adding another plausible distractor. For example:\n- \"It depends on the values of the variables\"\nThis distractor might attract students who are unsure about the specific behavior of the == operator and think that the result could vary based on the values being compared.\n\nIn summary, the question stem is well-written, and the single distractor provided is effective. However, the question would be stronger with an additional plausible distractor to reduce the likelihood of guessing the correct answer by process of elimination."

This principle can be evaluated as one of the following three options, label the evaluations as options 1 through 3.\n1: There are no obviously wrong options that give away the answer easily\n2: There is at least one option that can be easily eliminated as being incorrect\n\nWhen asked to evaluate a question, return the evaluation key.
