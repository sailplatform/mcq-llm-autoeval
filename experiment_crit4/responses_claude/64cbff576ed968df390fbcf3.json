The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "Let's evaluate this question by first answering it as a student familiar with Python programming.\n\nThe code snippet compares the value of the mathematical constant e (approximately 2.71828) with 2 raised to the power of 4 (which equals 16). Since these values are not equal, the result of the comparison math.e != math.pow(2, 4) will be True. When True is passed to int(), it is converted to the integer value 1.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \"1\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the distractors:\n\n1. \"False\": This distractor is incorrect because the result of the comparison is True, not False. However, it could be a plausible choice for a student who misinterprets the comparison or the conversion to an integer.\n\n2. \"0\": This distractor is incorrect because True is converted to 1, not 0. However, it could be a plausible choice for a student who misunderstands the behavior of int() when given a boolean value.\n\n3. \"True\": This distractor is incorrect because the print statement will output the integer value 1, not the boolean value True. However, it could be a plausible choice for a student who misunderstands the purpose of the int() function or the expected output.\n\nIn summary, all three distractors are plausible choices that a student might select if they have misconceptions about the comparison, the int() function, or the expected output. None of the distractors can be easily eliminated, as they all represent common misunderstandings or mistakes.\n\nTherefore, the distractors in this multiple-choice question are well-designed and effectively serve their purpose of distinguishing between students who fully understand the concepts and those who have misconceptions."

This principle can be evaluated as one of the following three options, label the evaluations as options 1 through 3.\n1: There are no obviously wrong options that give away the answer easily\n2: There is at least one option that can be easily eliminated as being incorrect\n\nWhen asked to evaluate a question, return the evaluation key.
