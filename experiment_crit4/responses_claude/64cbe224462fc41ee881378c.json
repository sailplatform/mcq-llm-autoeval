The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "Let me evaluate this question from the perspective of a student familiar with Python programming.\n\nThe stem asks about the purpose of the 'break' statement in a loop in Python. To answer this, I'll consider each choice:\n\n1. \"It suspends the execution of the current iteration and moves to the next.\" \nThis doesn't sound right. I know 'break' doesn't just pause the current iteration, it completely exits the loop.\n\n2. \"It terminates the entire loop and resumes execution at the next statement after the loop.\"\nYes, this matches my understanding. When 'break' is encountered, the loop is immediately terminated, and execution continues with the next statement after the loop.\n\n3. \"It skips the remaining statements in the current iteration and continues with the next iteration.\"\nThis sounds more like what the 'continue' statement does, not 'break'. So this is incorrect.\n\nThe correct answer is clearly choice 2.\n\nEvaluating the distractors:\n\nDistractor 1 mentions suspending execution and moving to the next iteration, which could be plausible to a student who is less confident about the exact behavior of 'break'. It's not obviously wrong.\n\nDistractor 3 describes the behavior of 'continue' rather than 'break'. A student who confuses these two might find this distractor tempting.\n\nBoth distractors are plausible wrong answers that test understanding of loop control statements. They can't be easily eliminated without a clear grasp of what 'break' does.\n\nIn summary, the distractors in this question are effective. They are not obviously incorrect, and they target common misconceptions or points of confusion. A student needs to have a solid understanding of 'break' to confidently select the correct answer."

This principle can be evaluated as one of the following three options, label the evaluations as options 1 through 3.\n1: There are no obviously wrong options that give away the answer easily\n2: There is at least one option that can be easily eliminated as being incorrect\n\nWhen asked to evaluate a question, return the evaluation key.
