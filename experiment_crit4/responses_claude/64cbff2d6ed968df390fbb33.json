The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "Let me first try to answer the question as a student familiar with Python.\n\nThe code is creating a tuple foo containing (1, 2, 3). It then tries to find the index of the value 0 in the tuple by calling foo.index(0).\n\nLooking at the answer choices:\n\n1. The program will output 1 to the screen. - This is incorrect, as the code is not printing anything.\n\n2. The program will cause an AttributeError exception. - This is incorrect. Tuples do have an index() method, so no AttributeError will occur.\n\n3. The program will cause a SyntaxError exception. - The syntax looks correct, so this is not the right answer.\n\n4. The program will cause a TypeError exception. - Incorrect. The types used in the code are valid (tuple and int), so no TypeError will be raised.\n\n5. The program will cause a ValueError exception. - This looks correct. The value 0 is not present in the tuple, so index() will raise a ValueError.\n\nSo as a student, I would select choice 5 as the correct answer.\n\nNow, evaluating the distractors:\n\nDistractors 1 and 3 can be easily eliminated by someone with basic Python knowledge. Distractor 1 mentions output which is clearly not happening in the code. Distractor 3 can be ruled out as the syntax is valid.\n\nDistractors 2 and 4 are better, as they mention exception types that could potentially occur when working with tuples and the index() method. However, a student with a clear understanding of when these exceptions are raised can still confidently eliminate them.\n\nTo improve the question, the distractors could be made more plausible:\n\n- Instead of a SyntaxError, a distractor mentioning an IndexError may be more challenging to eliminate.\n- Instead of an AttributeError, a distractor that says \"the program will execute without any exceptions\" could be tricky for students who are not fully sure about the behavior of index().\n\nSo in summary, while the current distractors are not entirely trivial, there is room to make them more challenging to eliminate for students who are not fully confident about exception types and the index() method behavior in Python."
