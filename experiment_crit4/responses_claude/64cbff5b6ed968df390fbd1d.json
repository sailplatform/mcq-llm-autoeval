The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "Let me evaluate this question from the perspective of a student familiar with Python programming.\n\nThe correct answer is \"raised\". When an exception occurs in Python, it is said to be \"raised\".\n\nLooking at the distractors:\n\n1. \"thrown\" - This is a plausible distractor. In some programming languages like Java, the terminology \"throwing an exception\" is used. So a student who has experience with other languages might be tempted to select this.\n\n2. \"dropped\" - This distractor is less effective. \"Dropping\" is not a term typically associated with exceptions in Python or most other programming languages. It would be fairly easy for a student to eliminate this option.\n\nEvaluating the distractors:\n\nThe distractor \"thrown\" is reasonably effective. It could potentially trick students who are drawing on their knowledge of other programming languages. \n\nHowever, the distractor \"dropped\" is quite weak. Most students with Python knowledge would likely be able to easily eliminate it, as it's not a commonly used term in the context of exceptions.\n\nTo improve this question, I would suggest replacing \"dropped\" with another distractor that is more closely related to exception handling terminology, to make it harder for students to rule it out. For example, \"caught\" could be a more tempting distractor, as \"catching\" exceptions is a related concept.\n\nIn summary, while one distractor is decent, the other one is too easily eliminated, so the overall quality of the distractors could be improved. The question tests the student's knowledge of the correct terminology, but with a stronger second distractor, it could better assess their understanding."

This principle can be evaluated as one of the following three options, label the evaluations as options 1 through 3.\n1: There are no obviously wrong options that give away the answer easily\n2: There is at least one option that can be easily eliminated as being incorrect\n\nWhen asked to evaluate a question, return the evaluation key.
