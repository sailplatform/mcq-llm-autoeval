The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "Let me evaluate this question from the perspective of a student familiar with Python programming.\n\nThe correct answer is range(1, 11), which will generate the sequence of numbers from 1 to 10 (inclusive).\n\nLooking at the distractors:\n\nrange(10) is incorrect because it will generate numbers from 0 to 9. This is a good distractor because it's a common mistake to forget that range(n) goes up to but does not include n.\n\nrange(0, 10) is also incorrect because it will generate numbers from 0 to 9. This is another good distractor because it's close to the correct answer but off by one on both the start and end.\n\nAs a student, I would have to think carefully about the parameters to the range function and mentally walk through the sequence of numbers each choice would generate. Both incorrect choices would be tempting for a student who doesn't fully grasp the nuances of how range works.\n\nIn summary, I believe the distractors in this question are quite good. They represent common misunderstandings about the range function and can't be easily eliminated without a solid understanding of how range and for loops work in Python. The distractors are plausible and would require me to carefully consider each choice to arrive at the correct answer."
