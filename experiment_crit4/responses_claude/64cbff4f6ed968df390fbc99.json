The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "From the perspective of a student familiar with Python programming, I would evaluate the distractors in this multiple-choice question as follows:\n\nThe correct answer, \"a space in which names exist\", accurately describes what a namespace is in Python. It is a clear and concise definition.\n\nLooking at the distractors:\n\n1. \"a name with space\" - This distractor is somewhat weak. While it uses similar words to the correct answer, it doesn't make much sense in the context of Python namespaces. A student with a basic understanding of namespaces would likely be able to eliminate this as a possible correct answer.\n\n2. \"a space with a name\" - This distractor is a bit stronger than the first one. It sounds more plausible, as namespaces in Python are indeed named spaces. However, it still doesn't quite capture the essence of what a namespace is - a space where names (identifiers) exist. A student with a solid grasp of namespaces might still be able to eliminate this.\n\nOverall, while the distractors use similar terminology to the correct answer, they don't fully serve their purpose of being plausible incorrect answers that test the student's understanding. The first distractor is quite weak and easily eliminated. The second is a bit better but still doesn't fully capture the concept.\n\nTo improve these distractors, I would suggest crafting incorrect answers that are more conceptually related to namespaces, perhaps common misconceptions or slightly off definitions. This would better test the student's depth of understanding of the topic."

This principle can be evaluated as one of the following three options, label the evaluations as options 1 through 3.\n1: There are no obviously wrong options that give away the answer easily\n2: There is at least one option that can be easily eliminated as being incorrect\n\nWhen asked to evaluate a question, return the evaluation key.
