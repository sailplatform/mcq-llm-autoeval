The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "From the perspective of a student familiar with Python programming, I would evaluate the distractors in this multiple-choice question as follows:\n\nDistractor 1: This distractor can be eliminated because it incorrectly states that the addition operator is being redefined to sum the number of chemical elements. The code snippet shows that the addition operator is actually being redefined to join the symbols (names) of the elements, not their atomic numbers. It also has the wrong method signature for operator overloading the + operator.\n\nDistractor 3: This distractor can be eliminated because the len() function is not being redefined in this code at all. The len() function is called on element1.name, but it is using the built-in len() behavior for strings, not a custom implementation. \n\nDistractor 4: Similar to distractor 3, this option can be eliminated because len() is not being redefined. It also has the wrong method signature for redefining the len() function.\n\nThe correct answer is appropriately challenging, as it correctly identifies that the code is demonstrating operator overloading (polymorphism) of the addition operator to concatenate element names.\n\nHowever, two of the three distractors can be easily eliminated by someone with basic Python knowledge, as they reference redefining the len() function which is not shown in the code snippet at all. The first distractor is a bit better, but still makes claims about summing atomic numbers which is not supported by the code.\n\nTo improve the distractors, I would suggest:\n1) Modifying distractor 1 to remove the incorrect reference to summing atomic numbers \n2) Replacing distractors 3 and 4 with options that relate to the actual operator overloading in the code snippet, perhaps with incorrect method signatures or return values\n\nThis would make all the distractors plausible for a student still learning operator overloading, requiring them to reason through each one carefully. As is, the current distractors are too easily eliminated, making this a lower quality multiple-choice question. The stem and correct answer are good, but the distractors need improvement."
