The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "Let me evaluate this multiple-choice question by first attempting to answer it as a student familiar with Python programming.\n\nThe question presents a code snippet with nested functions. The outer_function() defines a variable outer_value and assigns it the string 'Hello!'. It then defines an inner function inner_function() which also defines a variable outer_value but assigns it the string 'Goodbye!'. \n\nThe outer_function() then calls inner_function() and afterwards prints the value of outer_value.\n\nWhen inner_function() is called, it creates a new local scope. The outer_value variable defined inside it is separate from the one in outer_function(). It doesn't modify the outer_value in the enclosing scope.\n\nTherefore, when outer_function() prints outer_value after calling inner_function(), it will print 'Hello!' since that was the value assigned to outer_value in its local scope. The correct answer is 'Hello!'.\n\nNow let's evaluate the distractors:\n\n1. 'Goodbye!' - This is what the outer_value inside inner_function() is set to. A student less familiar with variable scoping rules in Python might think this will be printed. It's a plausible distractor.\n\n2. The program throws a NameError. - There are no obvious NameErrors in this code. The variables are all properly defined before use. However, a student who is unsure about how nested functions handle variables may think there is an error. It's a somewhat plausible distractor for students not fully comfortable with the concept.\n\nOverall, the distractors are fairly good. They represent misunderstandings a student might have about variable scope and nested functions. The 'Goodbye!' distractor is stronger than the NameError one, as it more directly relates to the key concept being tested.\n\nTo improve, the NameError distractor could perhaps be replaced with one that represents another common misunderstanding about nested function behavior or variable scope. But overall, this is a solid multiple-choice question. The distractors are not obviously incorrect and test relevant misunderstandings of the concept."
