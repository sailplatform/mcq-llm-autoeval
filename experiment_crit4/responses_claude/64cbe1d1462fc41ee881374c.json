The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "Let me evaluate this question from the perspective of a student familiar with Python programming.\n\nThe correct answer is simply \"condition\". This is the proper syntax for a conditional expression in Python - the boolean expression itself (in this case the variable \"condition\") goes between the first part of the expression and the \"else\" keyword.\n\nLooking at the distractors:\n\n1. \"condition == True\" \nThis distractor is plausible. A student might think they need to explicitly compare the condition to True. In reality, this is redundant since the variable itself will evaluate to True or False. But it's a reasonable mistake.\n\n2. \"condition is not False\"\nThis distractor is also quite plausible. Using \"is not\" instead of \"!=\" is a common way to compare to boolean values in Python. And logically, \"condition is not False\" is equivalent to \"condition\" if condition is a boolean. So a student could easily select this thinking it's a valid alternative.\n\nFrom a student perspective, I would have to think carefully to eliminate these distractors. They are not obviously incorrect and require a precise understanding of how conditional expressions work in Python to rule out. \n\nTherefore, I believe the distractors in this question are quite good. They represent plausible misunderstandings or mistakes a student might make. Eliminating them requires the student to have a clear grasp of the concept being tested.\n\nThe distractors are appropriately challenging without being deceptive or unfair. So in summary, this appears to be a well-constructed multiple-choice question that effectively assesses the intended learning objective."
