The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "Let me first try to answer the question as a student familiar with Python programming.\n\nThe question is asking about properly invoking the superclass constructor from the subclass constructor. The correct way to do this is to call `A.__init__(self)`, passing the current instance (`self`) to the superclass constructor.\n\nNow let's evaluate the distractors:\n\n1. `A.__init__()` - This is incorrect because it doesn't pass the `self` argument to the superclass constructor. However, it's a plausible distractor because a student might forget to pass `self`.\n\n2. `A.__init__(1)` - This is incorrect because it passes the argument `1` instead of `self` to the superclass constructor. It's a decent distractor because a student might mistakenly think they need to pass the value of `self.a`.\n\n3. `__init__()` - This is incorrect because it doesn't specify the superclass `A` when calling the constructor. It's not a great distractor because it's quite different from the correct answer and doesn't fully address the question of invoking the superclass constructor.\n\nOverall, distractors 1 and 2 are fairly good because they represent common mistakes a student might make when invoking a superclass constructor. They can't be easily eliminated without a solid understanding of the concept.\n\nDistractor 3 is weaker because it doesn't really attempt to invoke the superclass constructor at all. A student with a basic understanding of inheritance and constructors would likely be able to eliminate this option.\n\nTo improve the question, I would suggest replacing distractor 3 with something like `super().__init__()`, which is a more plausible alternative for invoking the superclass constructor.\n\nIn summary, two of the three distractors are quite good, but one could be improved to make the question more challenging for students with a solid grasp of the concept being tested."
