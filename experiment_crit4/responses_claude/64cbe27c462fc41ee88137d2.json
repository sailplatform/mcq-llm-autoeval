The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "Let me evaluate this question from the perspective of a student familiar with Python programming.\n\nThe correct answer is: \"It is a logical grouping of data (attributes) and functions/methods that operate on them.\"\n\nNow let's look at the distractors:\n\n1. \"It is a physical entity that exists in the real world.\"\nThis distractor is quite weak. In the context of object-oriented programming, objects are conceptual entities within a program, not physical entities. A student with a basic understanding of OOP would likely eliminate this choice quickly.\n\n2. \"It is an abstraction of a real-world process.\" \nThis distractor is better than the first one. Objects in OOP can sometimes represent real-world concepts or processes. However, this is not the best description of what an object fundamentally is in OOP. A student with a solid grasp of OOP principles might still be able to eliminate this choice, as it doesn't capture the core idea of an object being a grouping of data and methods.\n\nOverall, the distractors in this question are not very strong. The first distractor is quite weak and easily eliminated. The second distractor is better but still not ideal, as it doesn't fully capture the essence of an object in OOP.\n\nTo improve this question, I would suggest replacing the first distractor with a statement that is closer to the correct answer but still incorrect. For example: \"It is a function that performs a specific task on a set of input parameters.\" This distractor touches on the idea of methods/functions but misses the crucial aspect of an object grouping data and methods together.\n\nThe second distractor could also be improved to be more plausible, perhaps something like: \"It is a template that defines the properties and behaviors of a specific type of entity.\" This is closer to the concept of a class in OOP, which could make it a more challenging distractor for students still solidifying their understanding of objects vs. classes."
