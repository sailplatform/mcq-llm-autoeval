The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "Let me first try to answer the question as a student familiar with Python programming.\n\nThe function m takes a parameter x and returns 2 times the value of x. So an appropriate name would be one that indicates the function returns twice the input value.\n\nLooking at the choices:\n- \"duplicated_value_of\" implies returning the same value twice, which is incorrect.\n- \"twice\" accurately describes returning 2 times the input, so this looks like the correct answer.\n- \"multiply\" is too generic, as it doesn't specify what the input is being multiplied by. \n- \"square\" means multiplying the input by itself, which is not what this function does.\n\nSo I would select \"twice\" as the correct answer.\n\nNow evaluating the distractors from the perspective of an assessment creator:\n\nThe distractor \"duplicated_value_of\" can be easily eliminated, as duplicating a value means having two of the same value, not multiplying it by 2. This is not a strong distractor.\n\n\"multiply\" is a better distractor, as the function does perform multiplication. However, it is still fairly easy to eliminate since it is too vague compared to \"twice\". A stronger distractor might be something like \"multiply_by_2\".\n\n\"square\" is the strongest distractor of the three, as it is a specific operation, and one that is relevant to the concept being tested (simple math operations). A student needs to recognize that squaring means multiplying a number by itself, not by 2, in order to eliminate it. \n\nIn summary, one distractor is quite weak and can be easily eliminated, one is acceptable but could be improved, and one is appropriately challenging. I would suggest replacing \"duplicated_value_of\" with a stronger distractor, and possibly refining \"multiply\" to be more specific, in order to have three consistently strong incorrect answer choices."
