The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "Let me evaluate this question by first attempting to answer it as a student familiar with Python.\n\nGiven the list of integers:\nnumbers = [3, 7, 1, 9, 12, 5, 4, 2, 8, 11, 6]\n\nTo sort the list in descending order, I would use the sort() method with the reverse parameter set to True, like this:\nnumbers.sort(reverse=True)\n\nLooking at the answer choices:\n\n1. numbers.reverse() - This would reverse the order of the list, but not actually sort it. It could be a plausible distractor if I wasn't fully clear on the difference between reversing and sorting.\n\n2. numbers.sort(reverse=True) - This is the correct answer, as it sorts the list in-place in descending order.\n\n3. sorted(numbers, reverse=True) - This would return a new sorted list in descending order, but it wouldn't modify the original numbers list. It's a plausible distractor if I didn't fully understand the difference between sort() and sorted().\n\nEvaluating the distractors:\n\nBoth distractors are quite good. They represent common misconceptions or errors:\n1. Confusing reversing a list with sorting it \n2. Confusing the sort() method which modifies the list in-place, with the sorted() function which returns a new sorted list.\n\nA student who isn't fully clear on these concepts could easily choose one of the distractors.\n\nThe distractors can't be easily eliminated, as they both involve valid Python code that deals with ordering a list. A student would need to have a clear understanding of the specifics of sorting vs reversing, and the sort() method vs the sorted() function, to confidently identify the correct answer.\n\nIn summary, this is a well-constructed multiple-choice question. The stem is clear, the correct answer is unambiguous, and the distractors are plausible and test for common misunderstandings. They can't be easily eliminated without a solid grasp of the concepts being tested."
