The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "Let me first try to answer the question as a student familiar with Python programming.\n\nThe code is trying to add two numbers using the add() function, but it's passing a string '1' and an integer 2 as arguments. This will cause a TypeError at runtime because the + operator cannot concatenate a string and an integer.\n\nLooking at the choices:\n1. Line 1 defines the function correctly, so this is not the source of the error.\n2. Line 2 performs the addition, but it's not the direct cause of the error.\n3. Line 4 is where the add() function is called with the incorrect argument types, so this is the line that should be blamed for the TypeError.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is choice 3 (line 4).\n\nNow, evaluating the distractors:\n\nDistractor 1 (line 1) is a plausible distractor. A student who is less familiar with Python might think the error is in the function definition, even though it's correctly defined.\n\nDistractor 2 (line 2) is also a plausible distractor. The student might think the error is in the addition operation itself, rather than the arguments passed to the function.\n\nBoth distractors are relevant to the question and cannot be easily eliminated. They represent common misconceptions or mistakes a student might make when identifying the source of the error.\n\nIn summary, the distractors in this multiple-choice question are well-constructed. They are plausible and cannot be easily ruled out by a student who is not confident about the concepts being tested. The distractors effectively assess the student's understanding of function definitions, argument passing, and error identification in Python code."
