The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

There must be no incorrect answers that can easily be eliminated.\n"

        "content": "Let me evaluate this question from the perspective of a student familiar with Python programming.\n\nThe stem presents a code snippet that takes user input using the input() function, stores it in the user_input variable, and then prints a message along with the user_input value.\n\nNow, let's look at the answer choices:\n\n1. \"The number you entered is:  10\" - This seems to be the correct answer based on the print statement in the code.\n\n2. \"10\" - This is incorrect because the output includes the message \"The number you entered is:\" before the actual input value.\n\n3. \"The number you entered is: 10\" - This is incorrect but very close to the correct answer. The only difference is the lack of an extra space before the number 10.\n\nEvaluating the distractors:\nDistractor 2 (\"10\") can be easily eliminated by a student who understands that the print statement includes a message along with the user input. It's not a strong distractor.\n\nHowever, distractor 3 (\"The number you entered is: 10\") is a good distractor. It is very close to the correct answer, and a student might select it if they don't pay close attention to the exact spacing in the output. The lack of an extra space before the number 10 makes it subtly different from the correct answer.\n\nIn summary, distractor 2 is weak and can be easily eliminated, while distractor 3 is a strong distractor that might trick students who don't carefully examine the output format. To improve the question, I would suggest replacing distractor 2 with another option that is more plausible and not as easily dismissible."

This principle can be evaluated as one of the following three options, label the evaluations as options 1 through 3.\n1: There are no obviously wrong options that give away the answer easily\n2: There is at least one option that can be easily eliminated as being incorrect\n\nWhen asked to evaluate a question, return the evaluation key.
