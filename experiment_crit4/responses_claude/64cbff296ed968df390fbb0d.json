The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "Let me first try to answer this question as a student familiar with Python.\n\nThe code manipulates two lists, `places` and `mystery`. It assigns slices of strings from `places` to elements of `mystery`, pops the last element from `places`, and concatenates a character to an element of `mystery`. Finally, it prints the elements of `mystery`.\n\nAfter analyzing the code, the output will be:\nhi\nthere\n\nSo the correct answer is `\"hi\\nthere\"`.\n\nNow let's evaluate the distractors:\n\n1. `\"Oh\\nMaine\"` - This is a plausible distractor. It uses the correct slice `places[0][1:3]` which is \"hi\", but incorrectly assumes `places[2]` (\"Maine\") is concatenated to `mystery[1]` instead of just the last character \"e\". A student could fall for this if they don't carefully trace the code.\n\n2. `\"Oh\\nNorth\"` - This distractor is less plausible. It correctly identifies that only a substring of `places[1]` is used, but \"North\" is not the right substring. It should be \"ther\". Also, it incorrectly uses \"Oh\" instead of \"hi\".\n\n3. `\"hi\\nthen\"` - This is a fairly good distractor. It gets the first part \"hi\" correct, and the second part \"then\" is close to \"ther\" which is the substring used from `places[1]`. A student might choose this if they don't notice the 'e' being concatenated from `places[2]`.\n\nOverall, the distractors are fairly good. Distractor 1 and 3 are quite plausible and could trick students who don't trace the code carefully. Distractor 2 is a bit weaker as it's less likely to be chosen.\n\nTo improve, distractor 2 could be replaced with something like `\"hi\\ntheri\"` which would be closer to the correct answer and thus more distracting. But overall, the distractors do a decent job at testing a student's understanding of list manipulation and string slicing in Python."
