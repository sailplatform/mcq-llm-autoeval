The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

Each item in the warehouse is represented by an SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) number, its name, and the current quantity on hand. You realized that this would be a great scenario to apply object-oriented programming. You decide to create a class named 'Item'. \\n\\n What should be the attributes and methods in your 'Item' class to handle the inventory manage tasks effectively?\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"Attributes: SKU, name, quantity; Methods: add_quantity, reduce_quantity, get_details\",\n            \"correct\": \"true\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"Attributes: SKU, name; Methods: add_Item, delete_Item\",\n            \"correct\": \"false\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"Attributes: SKU, name, price; Methods: calculate_total_price, get_details\",\n            \"correct\": \"false\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nFrom the perspective of a student answering this Multiple-choice question, how good are the distractors?

        "content": "From the perspective of a student familiar with Python programming and object-oriented concepts, I would evaluate the distractors as follows:\n\nDistractor 1: \"Attributes: SKU, name; Methods: add_Item, delete_Item\"\nThis distractor is not as strong because it is missing the crucial \"quantity\" attribute, which is necessary for an inventory management system. The methods \"add_Item\" and \"delete_Item\" are not as relevant for managing the quantity of individual items. A student with a good understanding of the problem would likely eliminate this option.\n\nDistractor 2: \"Attributes: SKU, name, price; Methods: calculate_total_price, get_details\"\nThis distractor is better than the first one. It includes the \"SKU\" and \"name\" attributes, which are relevant for identifying items. However, it introduces the \"price\" attribute and the \"calculate_total_price\" method, which are not mentioned in the problem description and are not directly related to managing item quantities. A student might still consider this option if they don't carefully read the question.\n\nThe correct answer, \"Attributes: SKU, name, quantity; Methods: add_quantity, reduce_quantity, get_details,\" is the most appropriate choice given the context of the inventory management system and the need to handle quantities effectively.\n\nTo improve the distractors, I would suggest:\n1. Modifying distractor 1 to include the \"quantity\" attribute but with less relevant methods, such as \"update_name\" or \"delete_item.\"\n2. Adjusting distractor 2 to include the \"quantity\" attribute instead of \"price\" and replacing the \"calculate_total_price\" method with a less suitable method like \"update_sku.\"\n\nThese changes would make the distractors more plausible and challenging for students who might not thoroughly analyze the problem requirements."
