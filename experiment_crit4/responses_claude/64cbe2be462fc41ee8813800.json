The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "From the perspective of a student familiar with Python programming, I would evaluate the distractors in this multiple-choice question as follows:\n\nDistractor 1: 'employee1 is the Manager and earns 67000 dollars per year.'\nThis distractor is plausible because it uses the correct position and salary values. However, it uses the variable name 'employee1' instead of the employee's actual name 'John Doe'. A student who understands object-oriented programming in Python would recognize that the print_salary_info() method returns a string that includes the 'name' attribute, not the variable name. Therefore, this distractor can be eliminated by a student with a solid understanding of the concept being tested.\n\nDistractor 2: 'John Doe is the employee1 and earns None dollars per year.'\nThis distractor is less plausible. While it correctly uses the employee's name 'John Doe', it incorrectly states that the employee's position is 'employee1' (which is the variable name, not the position) and that the salary is 'None' (even though the salary is clearly set to 67000 in the constructor). A student with a basic understanding of Python syntax and object-oriented programming would likely be able to eliminate this distractor.\n\nOverall, the distractors in this multiple-choice question are of mixed quality. Distractor 1 is a plausible wrong answer that could potentially trick students who don't fully grasp the concept of object attributes and string formatting. However, Distractor 2 is a weaker choice that most students with a basic understanding of Python would be able to eliminate.\n\nTo improve the question, I would suggest replacing Distractor 2 with a more plausible option that aligns with common misconceptions or errors related to the concept being tested. For example, a distractor that uses the correct name and position but an incorrect salary value could be more effective at distinguishing between students who fully understand the concept and those who have incomplete knowledge."
