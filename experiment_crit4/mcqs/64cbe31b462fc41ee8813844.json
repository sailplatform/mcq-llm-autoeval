You decide to optimize it using a standard Python module that could solve the problem more efficiently. Which module should replace the blank?\n```python\nimport ______ as np\n\n# The current slow running function\ndef calculate_median(lst):\n    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)\n    list_length = len(lst)\n    num = list_length // 2\n    if list_length % 2 == 0:\n        return (sorted_lst[num - 1] + sorted_lst[num]) / 2\n    else:\n        return sorted_lst[num]\n\n# The efficient function using the module\ndef calculate_median_efficiently(lst):\n    return np.median(lst)\n```",
