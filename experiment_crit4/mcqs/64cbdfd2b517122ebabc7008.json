    "question": "Consider the following two `numpy` arrays, `a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` and `b = np.array([6, 7, 8, 9, 10])`. Imagine you want to compute the element-wise multiplication of `a` and `b` resulting in a array (let's name it `res`) which should be `[6, 14, 24, 36, 50]`. \n\nFrom the following options, which one is the most appropriate way to perform this computation to take full advantage of array vectorization in numpy?",
