    "question": "You are developing an inventory management system for a warehouse using Python. Each item in the warehouse is represented by an SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) number, its name, and the current quantity on hand. You realized that this would be a great scenario to apply object-oriented programming. You decide to create a class named 'Item'. \n\n What should be the attributes and methods in your 'Item' class to handle the inventory manage tasks effectively?",
