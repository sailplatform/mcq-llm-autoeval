The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "The distractors in this multiple-choice question are quite good. Both distractors are plausible answers that a student might choose if they do not fully understand Python's syntax for conditional expressions. \n\nThe first distractor, \"condition == True\", is incorrect because it is unnecessary to explicitly compare a boolean variable to True in a conditional expression in Python. However, a student who is not familiar with this aspect of Python's syntax might choose this answer.\n\nThe second distractor, \"condition is not False\", is also incorrect because it is a more verbose and less idiomatic way to express the condition. However, it is a plausible answer that a student might choose if they are not familiar with Python's idiomatic syntax.\n\nThe correct answer, \"condition\", is the most concise and idiomatic way to express the condition in Python. A student who understands Python's syntax for conditional expressions would choose this answer.\n\nOverall, the distractors are effective because they are plausible answers that a student might choose if they do not fully understand Python's syntax for conditional expressions. They are not easily eliminated, which makes the question more challenging and a better test of the student's understanding."
