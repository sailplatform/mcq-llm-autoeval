The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

A high school student asks you this question: 'I have collected data for the last six months on different species of insects found in a particular area. For each month, I have the number of total specie identified, total insect population and the most dominating specie. I want to make a line graph for the six months, but all three values in one line graph is confusing. How should I adjust the graph?'\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"Plot all data points in one line graph without any differentiation.\",\n            \"correct\": \"false\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"Use a line graph only for the number of total species identified each month, a separate bar chart for total insect population every month, and a pie chart representing the most dominating specie each month.\",\n            \"correct\": \"true\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"Use only one type of graph (line, pie or bar) for all three data points.\",\n            \"correct\": \"false\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nFrom the perspective of a student answering this Multiple-choice question, how good are the distractors? There must be no incorrect answers that can easily be eliminated."

        "content": "The distractors in this multiple-choice question are well constructed. They are plausible and not easily eliminated, which makes the question more challenging and effective at assessing the student's understanding.\n\nThe first distractor, \"Plot all data points in one line graph without any differentiation,\" is a common mistake made by beginners in data visualization. It's plausible that a student might think this is the correct answer if they don't understand the importance of clarity and differentiation in data visualization.\n\nThe second distractor, \"Use only one type of graph (line, pie or bar) for all three data points,\" is also a plausible mistake. It's a common misconception that using the same type of graph for all data points is simpler and therefore better. However, different types of data are often better represented with different types of graphs.\n\nThe correct answer, \"Use a line graph only for the number of total species identified each month, a separate bar chart for total insect population every month, and a pie chart representing the most dominating specie each month,\" is the best choice because it uses different types of graphs to represent different types of data, which makes the data easier to understand.\n\nOverall, this question is well designed and effective at assessing a student's understanding of data visualization."
