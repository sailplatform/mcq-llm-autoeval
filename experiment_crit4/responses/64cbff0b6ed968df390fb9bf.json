The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "The distractors in this multiple-choice question are well constructed. They cover a range of possible outcomes, which makes it harder for a student to eliminate incorrect answers without a solid understanding of the topic. \n\nThe first distractor, \"Only `test_average_velocity()` will pass,\" is plausible because it suggests that only one of the functions is correctly implemented. However, a student with a good understanding of Python will know that the `average_velocity` function is not correctly implemented because it returns a hard-coded string instead of a calculated value.\n\nThe second distractor, \"`test_average_speed()` and `test_average_velocity()` will pass,\" is also plausible because it suggests that two of the functions are correctly implemented. However, as mentioned above, the `average_velocity` function is not correctly implemented.\n\nThe fourth distractor, \"All three tests will pass,\" is plausible because it suggests that all functions are correctly implemented. However, the `displacement` function is not implemented at all (it just contains the `pass` statement), and the `average_velocity` function is not correctly implemented.\n\nThe fifth distractor, \"None of the three tests will pass,\" is plausible because it suggests that all functions are incorrectly implemented. However, the `average_speed` function is correctly implemented.\n\nIn conclusion, the distractors are well constructed and cannot be easily eliminated without a good understanding of Python programming."
