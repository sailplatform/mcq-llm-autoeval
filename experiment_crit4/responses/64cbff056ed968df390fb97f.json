The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "The distractors in this multiple-choice question are quite good. They are all plausible answers that a student might choose if they are not completely sure about how to load a CSV file into a DataFrame in Python. \n\nThe first distractor \"`pd.read_csv(\\\"tickets_monthly.csv\\\", index=0)`\" is incorrect because the correct parameter for setting the index column when reading a CSV file is `index_col`, not `index`.\n\nThe second distractor \"`pd.read_csv(\\\"tickets_monthly\\\", index_col=0)`\" is incorrect because it's missing the file extension `.csv` in the filename.\n\nThe third distractor \"`pd.read_csv(\\\"tickets_monthly.csv\\\", index_col=0)`\" is incorrect because it's missing the assignment to a variable `df`.\n\nThe fifth distractor \"`df = pd.read_csv(\\\"tickets_monthly.csv\\\", index='month')`\" is incorrect because the `index_col` parameter expects an integer (the column number), not a string (the column name).\n\nAll of these distractors are similar in format and structure to the correct answer, and they all represent common mistakes that a student might make when trying to load a CSV file into a DataFrame in Python. Therefore, they are effective at testing the student's understanding of this topic."
