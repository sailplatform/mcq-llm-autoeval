The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "The distractors in this multiple-choice question are well designed. They are not easily eliminated and require a good understanding of Python programming to answer correctly. \n\nThe stem of the question is clear and provides the necessary context for the student to answer the question. It asks about the expected value of the 'result' variable after a specific piece of Python code is executed. \n\nThe correct answer is \"`1`\", which is the integer representation of `True` in Python. This is because the expression `math.e != math.pow(2, 4)` is `True` as the value of `math.e` (approximately 2.71828) is not equal to `math.pow(2, 4)` (which is 16). The `print(int(result))` statement converts this `True` value to `1`.\n\nThe distractors \"`False`\", \"`0`\", and \"`True`\" are all plausible answers. \"`False`\" and \"`0`\" could be chosen if the student incorrectly thinks that `math.e` is equal to `math.pow(2, 4)`. \"`True`\" could be chosen if the student correctly identifies that `math.e` is not equal to `math.pow(2, 4)`, but forgets that the `True` value is converted to `1` by the `int()` function.\n\nTherefore, the distractors are effective in this question."
