The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "The distractors in this multiple-choice question are well constructed. They are not easily eliminated and require a good understanding of Python functions and the difference between returning a value and having a side-effect.\n\nThe first distractor might seem correct at first glance because it differentiates between a function returning a value and a function printing a value, which is a common way to distinguish between a function with a return value and a function with a side-effect. However, the question specifically asks for a function that also generates a report on temperature fluctuations, which the first distractor does not mention.\n\nThe second distractor, which is the correct answer, correctly describes a function that returns a value (calculates and returns the average temperature) and a function that has a side-effect (calculates the average temperature, prints the result, and updates a global variable).\n\nThe third distractor might also seem correct because it describes a function that returns a value and a function that does more than just return a value. However, the additional action in the first function (printing descriptive statistics) is not the same as generating a report on temperature fluctuations, which is what the question asks for.\n\nTherefore, the distractors are not easily eliminated and require a good understanding of the topic to answer correctly."
