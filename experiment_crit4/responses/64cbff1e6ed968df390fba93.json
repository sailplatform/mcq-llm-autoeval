The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "The distractors in this multiple-choice question are well designed and cannot be easily eliminated. \n\nThe first distractor \"Change Line 1 to: `side = float(1.2)`\" is a good distractor because it introduces the concept of type casting in Python, which might confuse some students. However, it is not necessary in this case because Python automatically converts the number to a float.\n\nThe second distractor \"Change Line 1 to: `float(side) = 1.2`\" is also a good distractor because it looks like a valid Python statement at first glance. However, it is incorrect because you cannot assign a value to a function call in Python.\n\nThe third distractor \"Change Line 1 to: `side_length = 1.2` and Line 2 to: `area = side_length * side_length`\" is a good distractor because it is a valid way to calculate the area of a square with a side length of 1.2 inches. However, it does not meet the requirement of changing the code as little as possible.\n\nTherefore, all distractors are plausible and cannot be easily eliminated, making this a high-quality multiple-choice question."
