The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "The distractors in this multiple-choice question are well designed and cannot be easily eliminated. \n\nMethod 1 is a good distractor because it includes a call to a non-existent `swim()` method, which might confuse students who are not careful enough to notice that such a method is not defined in the `Fish` class.\n\nMethod 2 is also a good distractor because it includes a parameter in the method definition that is not preceded by `self`, which is a common mistake made by beginners in Python. This distractor could trick students who are not familiar with the correct syntax for defining methods in a class.\n\nMethod 3 is a good distractor because it includes a parameter in the method definition and a call to a non-existent `swim()` method. This distractor could trick students who are not familiar with the correct syntax for defining methods in a class and those who do not notice that the `swim()` method is not defined in the `Fish` class.\n\nMethod 4 is the correct answer because it correctly defines a `stop` method that sets the `dx` attribute to 0, effectively stopping the fish's movement.\n\nOverall, the distractors are well designed and cannot be easily eliminated, making this a high-quality multiple-choice question."
