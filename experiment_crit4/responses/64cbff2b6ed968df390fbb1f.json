The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "The distractors in this multiple-choice question are well designed. They cover a range of possible outputs that could be expected from the given Python code snippet. \n\nThe first distractor \"`| Spring | Summer | Fall | ? |`\" is a good distractor because it represents the scenario where the student might think that tuples are immutable and cannot be changed.\n\nThe second distractor \"`| Spring | Summer | Fall |`\" could trick students who might think that the '?' character was removed but not replaced.\n\nThe third distractor \"`| Spring |`\" could mislead students who might think that the code only prints the first item in the tuple.\n\nThe fourth distractor \"Nothing. This program would raise an error.\" is also a good distractor because it represents the scenario where the student might think that the operation to change a tuple is not allowed and would cause an error.\n\nAll distractors are plausible and none of them can be easily eliminated without a good understanding of Python tuples and list conversion. Therefore, this question is well-constructed and would be effective in assessing a student's understanding of the topic."
