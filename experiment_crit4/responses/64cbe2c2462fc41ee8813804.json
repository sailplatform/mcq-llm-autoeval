The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

Each item in the warehouse is represented by an SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) number, its name, and the current quantity on hand. You realized that this would be a great scenario to apply object-oriented programming. You decide to create a class named 'Item'. \\n\\n What should be the attributes and methods in your 'Item' class to handle the inventory manage tasks effectively?\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"Attributes: SKU, name, quantity; Methods: add_quantity, reduce_quantity, get_details\",\n            \"correct\": \"true\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"Attributes: SKU, name; Methods: add_Item, delete_Item\",\n            \"correct\": \"false\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"Attributes: SKU, name, price; Methods: calculate_total_price, get_details\",\n            \"correct\": \"false\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nFrom the perspective of a student answering this Multiple-choice question, how good are the distractors? There must be no incorrect answers that can easily be eliminated."

        "content": "The distractors in this multiple-choice question are well constructed. They are plausible and relevant to the context of the question, which makes them effective in testing the student's understanding of object-oriented programming in Python.\n\nThe first distractor suggests a model where the quantity attribute is missing, which could be a common mistake if a student doesn't fully understand the requirements of an inventory management system. The methods suggested in this distractor, add_Item and delete_Item, could also be plausible if a student misunderstands the concept of managing individual items versus managing the inventory as a whole.\n\nThe second distractor introduces a new attribute, price, and a new method, calculate_total_price. This could be a plausible mistake if a student overthinks the requirements and assumes that price management should be part of the Item class, even though it's not mentioned in the question.\n\nOverall, these distractors are effective in testing the student's understanding of the question and the application of object-oriented programming in Python. They are not easily eliminated without a solid understanding of the topic."
