The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "The distractors in this multiple-choice question are not very effective. \n\nThe first distractor, \"used by coders from universities\", is not specific and can easily be eliminated by a student who has basic knowledge about UNICODE. It does not provide a plausible alternative to the correct answer.\n\nThe second distractor, \"honored by the whole universe\", is also not a good distractor. It is vague and does not provide a meaningful alternative to the correct answer. It can easily be eliminated by a student who understands that UNICODE is a computing industry standard for the consistent encoding, representation, and handling of text expressed in most of the world's writing systems.\n\nThe third distractor, \"for coding floating-point numbers\", is a bit more plausible but can still be easily eliminated by a student who knows that UNICODE is not used for coding numbers but for text and symbols.\n\nThe correct answer, \"like ASCII, but much more expansive\", is a good choice as it accurately describes UNICODE.\n\nIn conclusion, the distractors could be improved by making them more plausible and relevant to the topic of UNICODE. For example, a good distractor could be \"a standard for coding only English alphabets and numerals\", which is incorrect but might be plausible to a student who does not fully understand UNICODE."
