The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

They all represent common misconceptions or errors that a student might make when trying to call the superclass's `__init__` method from the subclass.\n\n1. \"`A.__init__()`\": This distractor is incorrect because it does not pass any argument to the `__init__` method, which requires at least one argument (`self`).\n\n2. \"`A.__init__(1)`\": This distractor is incorrect because it passes an integer instead of an instance of the class (`self`) to the `__init__` method.\n\n3. \"`__init__()`\": This distractor is incorrect because it attempts to call the `__init__` method without specifying the class (`A`) or an instance of the class (`self`).\n\nNone of these distractors can be easily eliminated without a solid understanding of how to properly call a superclass's `__init__` method from a subclass in Python, making them effective for assessing the student's understanding of this concept."
