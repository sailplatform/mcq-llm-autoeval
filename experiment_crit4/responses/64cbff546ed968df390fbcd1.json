The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nWhen evaluating a question, first try answering it from the perspective of a student who is familiar with Python programming.\n"

        "content": "The distractors in this multiple-choice question are well designed. They are all plausible answers for someone who is not familiar with the Python functions `ord()` and `chr()`. \n\nThe `ord()` function in Python gets the integer representation of a character, and the `chr()` function gets the character that represents a specific Unicode character. In the code, 'z' is converted to its integer representation, 2 is subtracted, and then it's converted back to a character. The correct answer is 'x', which is the character that represents the integer representation of 'z' minus 2.\n\nThe distractors are:\n- 'y': This could be a plausible answer if a student thinks that subtracting 2 from 'z' would result in 'y'.\n- 'z': This could be a plausible answer if a student doesn't understand what the `ord()` and `chr()` functions do and thinks the code doesn't change the character.\n- 'a': This could be a plausible answer if a student misinterprets the subtraction operation and thinks it wraps around to the start of the alphabet.\n\nTherefore, none of the distractors can be easily eliminated without understanding the Python functions used in the code."
