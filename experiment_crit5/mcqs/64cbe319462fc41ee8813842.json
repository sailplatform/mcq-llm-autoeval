    "question": "Charlie is a software developer working on a complex Python project. As the code base grows larger and more complex, Charlie has started to notice an increase in small bugs and inconsistencies. They primarily stem from style inconsistencies and slight differences in how different parts of the project use Python language constructs. Charlie knows that to ensure the long-term maintainability of the project, it's important to maintain a consistent style and to follow best practices.\\n\\nWhich automatic style checker or linting tool would be the most suitable and comprehensive choice for identifying and reporting style inconsistencies, common coding errors, and other potential problems in Charlie's Python project?",
