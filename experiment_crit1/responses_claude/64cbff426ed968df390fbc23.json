The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem and adheres to the following properties.\n1. A distractor should not be obviously wrong. In other words, it must still bear relations to the stem and correct answer. \n2. A distractor should be phrased positively and be a true statement that does not correctly answer the stem, all while giving no clues towards the correct answer.\n3. Although a distractor is incorrect, it must be plausible: in other words, it must be positioned such that a student who does not fully grasp the topic may believe that the distractor is the correct answer choice. Later provided with the topic and context students will be assessed on is a list of common misconceptions within that topic. \n4. A distractor must be incorrect. It cannot be correct, or interpreted as correct by someone who strongly grasps the topic.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\n\n"

        "content": "The provided multiple-choice question does not give enough context for a student to answer it correctly. To improve the question, consider the following:\n\n1. The question stem should clearly state the context in which the student is expected to evaluate the code snippet. For example, it should mention that the student is expected to have a basic understanding of Python's comparison and logical operators.\n\n2. The code snippet in the question stem is not properly formatted. It should be enclosed in triple backticks (```) to ensure proper formatting and readability.\n\n3. The distractors \"False\" and \"1\" are not plausible enough for a student who understands Python's comparison and logical operators. The distractor \"1\" is especially weak because the result of the expression will always be a boolean value (True or False), never an integer.\n\n4. The question does not provide any feedback for the answer choices, which could help students understand why a particular choice is correct or incorrect.\n\nTo improve the question, you could:\n\n1. Provide a clear context in the question stem about the student's expected knowledge.\n2. Format the code snippet properly using triple backticks.\n3. Create more plausible distractors that could potentially confuse students who do not fully grasp the concept of comparison and logical operators in Python.\n4. Add feedback for each answer choice to explain why it is correct or incorrect.\n\nBy addressing these points, the multiple-choice question can be made more effective in assessing a student's understanding of the intended topic."
