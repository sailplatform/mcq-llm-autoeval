The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem and adheres to the following properties.\n1. A distractor should not be obviously wrong. In other words, it must still bear relations to the stem and correct answer. \n2. A distractor should be phrased positively and be a true statement that does not correctly answer the stem, all while giving no clues towards the correct answer.\n3. Although a distractor is incorrect, it must be plausible: in other words, it must be positioned such that a student who does not fully grasp the topic may believe that the distractor is the correct answer choice. Later provided with the topic and context students will be assessed on is a list of common misconceptions within that topic. \n4. A distractor must be incorrect. It cannot be correct, or interpreted as correct by someone who strongly grasps the topic.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\n\n"

        "content": "The question text and choices provide enough information and context for a student to answer the question correctly, given they have the prerequisite knowledge about Python class inheritance and the `__init__` method. Here's why:\n\n1. The question stem clearly states the scenario: there is a superclass `A` and a subclass `B`. It also provides the code snippet showing the class definitions and asks where to place the selected line to invoke the superclass's `__init__` method.\n\n2. The answer choices present four different ways to invoke the superclass's `__init__` method, covering common variations and misconceptions:\n   - `A.__init__()`: Incorrect because it doesn't pass the `self` argument.\n   - `A.__init__(1)`: Incorrect because it passes an invalid argument `1` instead of `self`.\n   - `__init__()`: Incorrect because it doesn't specify the superclass `A` explicitly.\n   - `A.__init__(self)`: Correct because it explicitly calls the superclass's `__init__` method with the `self` argument.\n\n3. The question assumes the student has prior knowledge of the following concepts:\n   - Python class inheritance: The student should understand that a subclass inherits from a superclass using the `class B(A)` syntax.\n   - The `__init__` method: The student should know that `__init__` is a special method used for object initialization and that it takes the `self` parameter.\n   - Invoking superclass methods: The student should be familiar with the syntax to explicitly call a superclass's method from a subclass.\n\nGiven this context, a student with the required knowledge should be able to reason through the answer choices and select the correct one.\n\nThe question is well-structured and tests a specific concept in Python class inheritance. The distractors are plausible and represent common mistakes or misconceptions, making the question effective in assessing the student's understanding of the topic."
