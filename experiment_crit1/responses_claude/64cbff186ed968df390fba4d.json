The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem and adheres to the following properties.\n1. A distractor should not be obviously wrong. In other words, it must still bear relations to the stem and correct answer. \n2. A distractor should be phrased positively and be a true statement that does not correctly answer the stem, all while giving no clues towards the correct answer.\n3. Although a distractor is incorrect, it must be plausible: in other words, it must be positioned such that a student who does not fully grasp the topic may believe that the distractor is the correct answer choice. Later provided with the topic and context students will be assessed on is a list of common misconceptions within that topic. \n4. A distractor must be incorrect. It cannot be correct, or interpreted as correct by someone who strongly grasps the topic.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\n\n"

        "content": "The question text provides a good amount of context by showing the relevant code snippet and the desired output. This allows the student to analyze the code and determine what should be filled in the blank to produce the given output.\n\nHowever, there are a few areas where additional information or context could be beneficial:\n\n1. The question does not explicitly state the student's expected level of Python knowledge. It would be helpful to clarify if the student is expected to have a basic, intermediate, or advanced understanding of Python.\n\n2. The code snippet uses concepts like tuples, dictionaries, and string formatting, but the question does not mention if the student is expected to be familiar with these concepts. Clarifying the expected prerequisite knowledge would be useful.\n\n3. The question could provide a brief explanation of what the code is trying to achieve (e.g., printing a formatted table of temperature ranges for different cities). This would give the student a clearer understanding of the code's purpose.\n\nDespite these potential improvements, the question does provide enough information for a student with a solid understanding of Python to answer correctly. The correct answer choice is clear and the distractors are plausible but incorrect.\n\nIn summary, while the question is generally well-constructed, providing a bit more context about the expected Python knowledge level and the code's purpose could enhance its clarity and effectiveness."
