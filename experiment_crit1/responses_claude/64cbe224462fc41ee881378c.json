The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem and adheres to the following properties.\n1. A distractor should not be obviously wrong. In other words, it must still bear relations to the stem and correct answer. \n2. A distractor should be phrased positively and be a true statement that does not correctly answer the stem, all while giving no clues towards the correct answer.\n3. Although a distractor is incorrect, it must be plausible: in other words, it must be positioned such that a student who does not fully grasp the topic may believe that the distractor is the correct answer choice. Later provided with the topic and context students will be assessed on is a list of common misconceptions within that topic. \n4. A distractor must be incorrect. It cannot be correct, or interpreted as correct by someone who strongly grasps the topic.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\n\n"

        "content": "Yes, the question text and its choices provide enough information and context for a student to answer it correctly. Here's why:\n\n1. The stem (question) is clear and focused on a specific concept - the functionality of the 'break' statement in a Python loop. It doesn't require any additional context to understand what is being asked.\n\n2. The correct answer is precise and unambiguous. It correctly states that the 'break' statement \"terminates the entire loop and resumes execution at the next statement after the loop.\"\n\n3. The distractors are plausible and related to the topic of loop control statements, but they are not correct:\n   - The first distractor mentions suspending the current iteration and moving to the next, which is incorrect but might seem plausible to a student who confuses 'break' with 'continue'.\n   - The third distractor describes the behavior of the 'continue' statement, not 'break'. This could be a tempting choice for a student who hasn't fully grasped the difference between 'break' and 'continue'.\n\n4. The answer choices are homogeneous and parallel in structure, making them easy to read and compare.\n\nIn summary, a student with a basic understanding of Python loops and control statements should have sufficient information to identify the correct answer based on the question and the provided choices."
