The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem and adheres to the following properties.\n1. A distractor should not be obviously wrong. In other words, it must still bear relations to the stem and correct answer. \n2. A distractor should be phrased positively and be a true statement that does not correctly answer the stem, all while giving no clues towards the correct answer.\n3. Although a distractor is incorrect, it must be plausible: in other words, it must be positioned such that a student who does not fully grasp the topic may believe that the distractor is the correct answer choice. Later provided with the topic and context students will be assessed on is a list of common misconceptions within that topic. \n4. A distractor must be incorrect. It cannot be correct, or interpreted as correct by someone who strongly grasps the topic.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\n\n"

        "content": "The question text and choices provide sufficient information and context for a student to answer the question correctly, assuming the student has a basic understanding of Python and NumPy. Here's why:\n\n1. The question clearly states the objective: to compute the element-wise multiplication of two NumPy arrays, `a` and `b`, and store the result in a new array called `res`.\n\n2. The question provides the expected output, `[6, 14, 24, 36, 50]`, which helps the student understand what the correct result should be.\n\n3. The question emphasizes the importance of taking full advantage of array vectorization in NumPy, hinting that the correct answer should utilize NumPy's vectorized operations.\n\n4. The answer choices cover different approaches to perform the element-wise multiplication:\n   - Choice 1 uses a Python loop to iterate over the arrays and multiply corresponding elements, which does not take advantage of NumPy's vectorization.\n   - Choice 2 directly multiplies the arrays using the `*` operator, which is the most concise and efficient way to perform element-wise multiplication in NumPy.\n   - Choice 3 uses NumPy's `multiply()` function, which is a valid alternative to the `*` operator but slightly more verbose.\n\nThe question assumes that the student is familiar with basic Python syntax, NumPy arrays, and the concept of vectorization. If the student has this prerequisite knowledge, they should be able to identify the correct answer based on the information provided in the question and the answer choices."
