The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem and adheres to the following properties.\n1. A distractor should not be obviously wrong. In other words, it must still bear relations to the stem and correct answer. \n2. A distractor should be phrased positively and be a true statement that does not correctly answer the stem, all while giving no clues towards the correct answer.\n3. Although a distractor is incorrect, it must be plausible: in other words, it must be positioned such that a student who does not fully grasp the topic may believe that the distractor is the correct answer choice. Later provided with the topic and context students will be assessed on is a list of common misconceptions within that topic. \n4. A distractor must be incorrect. It cannot be correct, or interpreted as correct by someone who strongly grasps the topic.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\n\n"

        "content": "The given multiple-choice question provides sufficient information and context for a student to answer it correctly, assuming the student has a basic understanding of Python syntax and arithmetic operations. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The stem (question text) presents a clear and concise Python function named `average` that takes two parameters, `num1` and `num2`, and returns their average by adding them together and dividing the result by 2.\n\n2. The stem also specifies the values of the arguments (`num1 = 3.5` and `num2 = 4`) with which the function will be called.\n\n3. The answer choices are parallel in structure and represent possible outputs of the function call.\n\n4. The correct answer, 3.75, is indeed the expected output when calling the `average` function with the given arguments.\n\n5. The distractors, 3.5 and 7.5, are plausible but incorrect. A student who does not fully grasp the concept might mistakenly choose one of these options:\n   - 3.5 is the value of `num1`, but it does not represent the average of `num1` and `num2`.\n   - 7.5 is the sum of `num1` and `num2`, but the function divides the sum by 2 to calculate the average.\n\nIn summary, the question text and its choices provide enough information and context for a student with a basic understanding of Python and arithmetic operations to answer the question correctly."
