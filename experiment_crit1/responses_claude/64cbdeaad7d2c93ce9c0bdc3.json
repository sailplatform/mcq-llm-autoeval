The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem and adheres to the following properties.\n1. A distractor should not be obviously wrong. In other words, it must still bear relations to the stem and correct answer. \n2. A distractor should be phrased positively and be a true statement that does not correctly answer the stem, all while giving no clues towards the correct answer.\n3. Although a distractor is incorrect, it must be plausible: in other words, it must be positioned such that a student who does not fully grasp the topic may believe that the distractor is the correct answer choice. Later provided with the topic and context students will be assessed on is a list of common misconceptions within that topic. \n4. A distractor must be incorrect. It cannot be correct, or interpreted as correct by someone who strongly grasps the topic.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\n\n"

        "content": "The question text and choices provide enough information and context for a student to answer the question correctly, assuming the student has a basic understanding of the pandas library and how to manipulate DataFrames.\n\nThe question stem clearly outlines the task: to fill in the blanks in the code snippet to calculate the average grade for each student. It provides the necessary context by showing the structure of the 'grades' dataset and the desired output format.\n\nThe correct answer, \"method, Grades\", is the only choice that accurately completes the code snippet to achieve the desired result. The groupby() function groups the DataFrame by the 'Students' column, and the mean() method is then applied to calculate the average of the 'Grades' column for each student.\n\nThe two distractors are plausible but incorrect:\n1. \"method, Students\" is incorrect because calculating the mean of the 'Students' column would not provide meaningful information.\n2. \"function, Grades\" is incorrect because groupby() is a method, not a function.\n\nThe distractors are related to the stem and the correct answer, but they do not correctly complete the code snippet to produce the desired output.\n\nIn summary, the question and its choices are well-constructed, providing enough information and context for a student with basic pandas knowledge to answer correctly."
