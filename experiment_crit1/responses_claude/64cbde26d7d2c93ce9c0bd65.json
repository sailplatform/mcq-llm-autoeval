The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem and adheres to the following properties.\n1. A distractor should not be obviously wrong. In other words, it must still bear relations to the stem and correct answer. \n2. A distractor should be phrased positively and be a true statement that does not correctly answer the stem, all while giving no clues towards the correct answer.\n3. Although a distractor is incorrect, it must be plausible: in other words, it must be positioned such that a student who does not fully grasp the topic may believe that the distractor is the correct answer choice. Later provided with the topic and context students will be assessed on is a list of common misconceptions within that topic. \n4. A distractor must be incorrect. It cannot be correct, or interpreted as correct by someone who strongly grasps the topic.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\n\n"

This is a straightforward question that tests the student's knowledge of a specific Python concept.\n\nThe correct answer, \"str()\", is the built-in Python function used for converting other data types to strings.\n\nThe two distractors, \"string()\" and \"to_string()\", are plausible for students who may not fully grasp the concept or are more familiar with other programming languages:\n\n1. \"string()\" might seem correct to students who are not well-versed in Python's naming conventions for built-in functions.\n\n2. \"to_string()\" could be chosen by students who have experience with other programming languages where this naming convention is used for type conversion functions.\n\nBoth distractors are related to the concept of string conversion but are not correct in the context of Python.\n\nIn summary, the question is well-structured, and the answer choices are appropriate for assessing a student's understanding of Python's string conversion function."

Think of this from the perspective of a student answering the multiple-choice question. This principle can be evaluated as one of the following two options, label the evaluations as options 1 through 2.\n1: Yes, it provides enough information\n2: No, it doesn't provide enough information\n\nWhen asked to evaluate a question, return the evaluation key.
