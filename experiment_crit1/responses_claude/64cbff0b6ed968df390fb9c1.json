The three components of a multiple-choice question are as follows: a Stem, a Correct Answer, and two Distractors. There must always be only one correct answer and only two distractors.\nThe stem refers to the question the student will attempt to answer, as well as the relevant context necessary in order to answer the question. It may be in the form of a question, an incomplete statement, or a scenario. The stem should focus on assessing the specific knowledge or concept the question aims to evaluate.\n\nThe Correct Answer refers to the correct, undisputable answer to the question in the stem.\n\nA Distractor is an incorrect answer to the question in the stem and adheres to the following properties.\n1. A distractor should not be obviously wrong. In other words, it must still bear relations to the stem and correct answer. \n2. A distractor should be phrased positively and be a true statement that does not correctly answer the stem, all while giving no clues towards the correct answer.\n3. Although a distractor is incorrect, it must be plausible: in other words, it must be positioned such that a student who does not fully grasp the topic may believe that the distractor is the correct answer choice. Later provided with the topic and context students will be assessed on is a list of common misconceptions within that topic. \n4. A distractor must be incorrect. It cannot be correct, or interpreted as correct by someone who strongly grasps the topic.\n\nThe term \u201canswer choices\u201d is a phrase that refers to a grouping of the two distractors as well as the correct answer. A single \u201canswer choice\u201d refers to only one of the distractors or the correct answer. The answer choices should be homogeneous and parallel in format, such that they are of similar length and structure.\n\nMultiple-choice questions will be provided as JSON objects as follows.\n{\n    \"question\": \"<QUESTION_TEXT>\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"<CHOICE_TEXT>\",\n            \"correct\": <TRUE/FALSE>,\n            \"feedback\": \"<FEEDBACK_TEXT>\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\n\n"

        "content": "The provided multiple-choice question has a few issues that may hinder a student's ability to answer it correctly:\n\n1. Insufficient context: The question does not provide enough context about the topic being assessed. It is unclear what the function `average_velocity` is supposed to do or what the expected inputs and outputs are. Without this information, it is difficult for a student to determine whether the given implementation is a good tactic or not.\n\n2. Lack of clear expectations: The question does not specify what is meant by a \"by-passing approach\" or what the criteria are for determining if it is a \"good tactic to move forward quickly.\" This ambiguity makes it challenging for a student to evaluate the code snippet and make an informed decision.\n\n3. Missing distractors: The question only provides two answer choices, \"Yes\" and \"No,\" without any distractors. Distractors are important in multiple-choice questions as they help assess a student's understanding of the topic by presenting plausible but incorrect options.\n\n4. Lack of feedback: The answer choices do not include any feedback explaining why each choice is correct or incorrect. Feedback is crucial for reinforcing learning and helping students understand their mistakes.\n\nTo improve this multiple-choice question, the following changes should be made:\n1. Provide more context about the `average_velocity` function, its purpose, and the expected inputs and outputs.\n2. Clarify what is meant by a \"by-passing approach\" and what criteria should be used to evaluate if it is a good tactic.\n3. Add two plausible distractors that are related to the topic but are incorrect answers.\n4. Include feedback for each answer choice to explain why it is correct or incorrect.\n\nBy addressing these issues, the question will be more effective in assessing a student's understanding of the topic and providing a meaningful learning experience."
