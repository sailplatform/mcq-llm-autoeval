    "question": "James is designing an application to model a school. He creates a class named 'Student' to represent each student. Each student has a name, age, grade, and a list of courses they are taking. James wants to create a method in the Student class that will calculate and return the average grade of the student based on the grades in their courses. Which of the following is the best implementation of the Student class with this method?",
