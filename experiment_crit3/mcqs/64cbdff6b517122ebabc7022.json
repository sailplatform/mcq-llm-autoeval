    "question": "Oliver, a data scientist, is working on a project that involves processing a large dataset of grocery transactions. To analyze the data, he decides to take advantage of pandas Series, which can build on top of numpy datatypes. He needs to create a Series object that represents the quantity of apples sold each day over a given week, where the quantity sold might be in floating point numbers as there could be transactions with partial amounts.\\n\\nGiven that the record of sales is as follows: Monday - 35.5, Tuesday - 40, Wednesday - 30, Thursday - 50.2, Friday - 42, Saturday - 60.1, Sunday - 52.5. Which of the following code snippets does this accurately using pandas Series?",
