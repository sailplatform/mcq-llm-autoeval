    "question": "Suppose you have a function named `capitalize_name` in a Python file named `name_formatter.py` that capitalizes the first letter of a name and you have also written several tests for it in a different file named `test_name_formatter.py`. You are required to verify that the tests cover all lines of code in the `capitalize_name` function using a Python coverage library. Which of the following terminal commands would correctly provide the required test coverage? ",
